# 1.0 Introduction

## 1.1	Purpose

This documentation standard describes the format for the preparation of various types of documents mentioned herein under scope so that every document produced by any person in the organization is uniformly presentable, complete and consistent across the organization. 

## 1.2 Why do I need a Documention Standard?

The “documentation standard “is a reference document or a guideline that includes rules and suggestions for writing style and document presentation. Style guides often specify which option to use when several options exist, and they include items that are specific to the company or industry and items for which a “standard” or example does not exist through commercial style guides. 

The specific content in the style guide is not usually a matter of “correct” or “incorrect” grammar or style, but rather the decisions you or your employer or client have made from among the many possibilities. More specifically, style guides can serve several purposes:

* To ensure that documents conform to corporate image and policy, including legal requirements
* To inform new writers and editors of existing style and presentation decisions and solutions
* To define which style issues are negotiable and which are not
* To improve consistency within and among documents, especially when more than one writer is involved or when a document will be translated
* To remove the necessity to reinvent the wheel for every new project
* To serve as part of the specifications for the deliverables, when writing for clients outside your company or when outsourcing writing projects


## 1.3	Scope
This standard is applicable to the following four types of documents of Insync :
* Process and Product Documents
* Proposal
* All Customer-related documents and
* Training Material.

The Standards that are mentioned in Section 2.0 are applicable for all types of documents, while specific document type-related standards are mentioned in the Appendix.

# 2.0	Specific Description of the Standards

## 2.1	Document Writing Style

The style of a document is an important consideration to its preparation, because it establishes the effect of the document on the audience. *Clarity is the most important objective*. 

To improve the clarity of the documentation the following points should be taken care of:

* Short sentences are easier to understand
* Short paragraphs aid comprehension provided that its structure reflects proper organization of thoughts.

One should take care of the use of verbs to produce a document, which describes a procedure such as:  

*	“may” - providing advice
*	“should” - providing preferred option
*	“will” - suggesting intention
*	“shall” – mandatory
*	“must” - definitely mandatory	

Documentation is done as a communication to a target audience and as such should contain information that is of use to the reader.
The information in the document should be presented in a logical order suitable for the reader.
