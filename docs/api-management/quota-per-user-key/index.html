<p>The <strong>Rate-limit quota</strong> policy prevents an API usage spikes on per user basis, such that if the same API is 
getting somehow spammed, the policy will automatically detect it and updae the response accordingly. The 
API rate limit can be set up by the developer for a specified time period and when the policy is
triggered for a specific call, the caller will receive <code class="highlighter-rouge">429 Too Many Requests</code> as response status code.</p>

<p><strong>ProTip:</strong> Policy can only be used once per API configuration.</p>
