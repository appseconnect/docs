<p>Policies are hooks to an API which you can punch at differnt levels of execution. They are powerful capabilities to an API publisher
that can impose some change in behavior of an API. Policies are collection of statements which are execued sequentially
on the request or response of an API. They are applied either before execution of actual action (stated as InBound policies) or 
after the actual action has been executed (termed as Outbound Policies). Some policies can change the Http Pipeline of an API execution 
altogether.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-policies">Understanding Policies</h2>

<p>To understand policy infrastructure of an API let us dig deep into how the Http Pipeline of an API looks like
<img src="/staticfiles/api-management/media/api-policy-pipeline.png" alt="Api Policy Pipeline" /></p>

<p>In the above image, it is eminent that when a request is received to the API gateway, it goes through the pipeline 
first to authentication through user registry, then execute <code class="highlighter-rouge">Inbound</code> policies, next it executes the backend action 
to generate the response in XML format, executes the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Outbound</code> policies and finally returns the response 
back to the caller.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> Policies execute in sequential order, you can change the sequence anytime just to ensure the 
policies are configured correctly.</p>

<p>The policies are of two types:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Inbound</strong> : If the policies are applied before executing the actual action in the backend, the policy is termed as <code class="highlighter-rouge">Inbound</code> policy.</li>
  <li><strong>Outbound</strong> : If a policy is applied after the execution of backend action and the response result set is already generated, the policy is termed as <code class="highlighter-rouge">Outbound</code> policy.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="policy-scope">Policy Scope</h2>

<p>Policy scope is the area where the policies can be applied. The scope can be of different types :</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Scope</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Overrides</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Operation</td>
      <td>Applies to leaf level of an API, for example, when <code class="highlighter-rouge">Customer</code> is an API, Operation is <code class="highlighter-rouge">GET</code> of a Customer.</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>API</td>
      <td>Applies to a particular API and automatically override all <code class="highlighter-rouge">Operation</code> of the API</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Organization</td>
      <td>Applies to all APIs of an organization</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Base</td>
      <td>Applies to all organization irrespective of any API</td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Once <code class="highlighter-rouge">Inbound</code>specifies the scope of the policy to be applied before execution of main data source and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Outbound</code>specifies it after the execution of main data source.</p>

<p><strong>Protip</strong> Do not validate a request in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Outbound</code> scope, as it will always consume your resources and response time will be increased</p>
