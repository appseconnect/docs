<p>Getting started with APIs isnt always easy, there are tons of documents and techniques that can be used to leverage the idea of building your own
APIs. The API, how simple it is, requires a big amount of ground work so as to ensure the API is properly utilized 
and secured. The API needs to be properly organized, maintained and well documented, such that the API could be consumed correctly.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-an-api">What is an API?</h1>

<p>API or Application Programming Interface is defined as a software term that allows two applications to talk to each other, send 
messages, request for a resource modification etc. API is used to create a bridge between the two application 
using a set of protocol that the two application mutually understand.</p>

<p>In mordern day world, API is sometimes used interchangebly with Web APIs which means an interface that gives a web url or web based endpoint
which can be called anytime using proper HTTP verbs (GET, PUT, POST, PATCH etc.) to perform operation on a particular resource or a batch of 
resources.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-api-management">What is API Management?</h1>

<p>API Management of <code class="highlighter-rouge">APPSeCONNECT</code> helps an organization to create, maintain and publish APIs for their various data sources 
such that the data can be easily accessed and maintained quickly without needing 
a separate development team. The API management platform provides an interface which any developer can 
access to create or configure services.</p>

<p>Companies today want to make their various data sources to be available through web so that these data sources and services can be consumed by apps running on mobile or desktops. 
For instance, a company can provide APIs to announce product pricing such that when any change is made to 
the prices, the API automatically gets an update and notifies the API consumers easily.</p>

<p>API management provides core competencies which will allow developers or implementers to publish, 
protect and secure API gateway which follows industry standard protocol <code class="highlighter-rouge">Representational State Transfer</code> (REST) to ensure 
the API can be consumed easily from 3rd party applications. This article probvides an overview of common scenarios
that involve API Management. It also gives a brief overview of the main components used in the API 
program.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-restful-api">What is RESTFul API?</h2>

<p>One of the most popular protocol that is prevalent in the market today is REST or RESTFul APIs. The REST is 
named as Representational State Transfer is very easy to understand and fully utilizes all the advantages of 
HTTP (Hyper Text Transport Protocol). This means as an API consumer, there is no need to install additional 
software or tools to consume such APIs.</p>

<p>REST as a protocol gives lot of flexibility to the consumers. It is not tied directly to a particular resource 
or methods, and hence it can handle multiple types of calls, can return a number of data 
formats, and even can change the data scheme. Hence, we can say, REST uses correct implementation of Hypermedia.</p>

<h2 id="planning-your-api">Planning your API</h2>

<p>Planning an API and designing it before actually implementing it on any API stack is sometimes important. Most of the steps
should be performed while designing and planning an API such that the API after developed and 
being consumed by a large number of consumers are less changed and / or revised.</p>

<p>By many means, building an API is just like designing and architecting a new house. You can say, 
that you need to build a house just like the one you point to, but without any blueprint or proper
desing and prepanning, it is high chance that the house would eventually look very different than 
one you have been intended for.  It is important that you create solid foundation of your API, just 
as you would do it for your house. You should understnad what your API should be able to do, and how 
it should work, how its scope could be and what are the things you want to hide from external users.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-design-api-endpoint-security">How to design API endpoint security</h2>

<p>Security is another important element for any application or service, especially when it is exposed through
www (or World Wide Web). There will be eventually a hundred or thousands of applications making calls to
the APIs on daily basis. It is important to protect your APIs from attacks.</p>

<h3 id="appseconnect-api-management">APPSeCONNECT API Management</h3>

<p>APPSeCONNECT being an <a href="/docs/architecture">API management platform</a> allows to create, manage, deploy, maintain APIs for an organization
such that the APIs can be easily tracked inside the organization. Let us look how to create or manage API management 
inside APPSeCONNECT platform.</p>

<h4 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h4>

<p>To create an API at the first place, there are a number of things you require,</p>

<ul>
  <li>You need an Active <a href="/appseconnect/home/">APPSeCONNECT Account</a>. Go to Home Page for login details</li>
  <li>You need to know all the data sources that are used for the APIs.</li>
  <li>You need to <a href="/api-management/choosing-backend-apps/">create or configure APPS</a> on the platform.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="registering-an-url">Registering an URL</h4>

<p>Once all the prerequisites are installed and configured correctly, the first thing that you need to do, is to register your 
API endpoint URL. To register an url,</p>

<ol>
  <li>Login to <a href="/appseconnect/home/">APPSeCONNECT Portal</a>. Go to Home Page for login details</li>
  <li>Go to API management from the sidebar.</li>
  <li>Select <code class="highlighter-rouge">Register</code>.</li>
  <li>A popup will open which will allow user to select a particular API <code class="highlighter-rouge">URL</code>(Uniform Resource Locator).</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/staticfiles/api-management/media/register-url-org.PNG" alt="Register Url Org" /></p>

<p>The registered base url for the organization will be at https://[registrationkey].appseconnectapi.com. Once a base url is registered
for the organization, you are ready to implement your first API on the platform.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>To create a new API, you have two option :</p>

    <p>i. Create a Webhook Endpoint (Webhooks are generally POST URLs without Authentication)</p>

    <p>ii. Create Proxy Endpoint</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In this article we will look primarly on Proxy APIs, which allows to create a full fledged 
API connecting to a specific backend application.</p>

<h4 id="configuring-authentication-server">Configuring Authentication Server</h4>

<p>To configure authentication server, click on <code class="highlighter-rouge">Authentication</code> button from top menu, a new popup
appears which will allow you to generate Client Id and Client Secrets.</p>

<p><img src="/staticfiles/api-management/media/authentication-genarate-api-key.PNG" alt="Authentication Genarate Api Key" /></p>

<p>In the popup, you are supposed to select a particular user for which you want to generate an API key. As per <code class="highlighter-rouge">Basic</code> authentication standard
you are supposed to provide <code class="highlighter-rouge">Authorization</code> header to every request. Each API will be validated to its users and 
a separate log will be created. When authoirization is failed, it will return <code class="highlighter-rouge">403 Forbidden</code> response.</p>

<h4 id="frontend-configuration">Frontend configuration</h4>

<p>To create a new API, first you need to select <code class="highlighter-rouge">Create API</code> button from the Proxy screen. A new popup will open which will allow user to 
create a new API through a wizard.</p>

<p>The Wizard starts with Basic Information screen which corresponds to the Frontend of the application. This section allows the organization to define
the API url endpoint, the description, the HTTP Method, Versioning, etc.</p>

<p><img src="/staticfiles/api-management/media/api-frontend-configuration.PNG" alt="Api Frontend Configuration" /></p>

<p>The URL generated for the API will be shown while data is created.</p>

<h4 id="apply-policies">Apply Policies</h4>

<p>Each API comes with a <a href="/api-management/policies/">number of policies</a> which can be applied to a certain API such that 
during execution, the rules will be applied automatically to that particular API. Here are the list
of policies that can be applied to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">APPSeCONNECT API</code> stack.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/api-management/ip-restrict/">IP Restrict Policy</a></li>
  <li><a href="/api-management/quota-per-user-key/">Quota per user Policy</a></li>
  <li><a href="/api-management/validate-http-header/">Invalidate HTTP Request Header Policy</a></li>
  <li><a href="/api-management/compression-apply/">Compress Response Policy</a></li>
  <li><a href="/api-management/response-content-format/">Response Content Format Transformation Policy</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="configuring-backend">Configuring Backend</h4>

<p>Backend is the main data source of an application. When configuring the data source, primarily, you need to first
consider whether the proper data source is picked up or not. To consider picking up correct resource you have two options</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/docs/api">Choosing Backend Application from Pre-packaged Apps</a></li>
  <li><a href="/docs/api">Creating new backend application connecting your data source</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Once the backend is properly selected, you can pick it for your API.</p>

<p><img src="/staticfiles/api-management/media/api-backend-configuration.PNG" alt="Api Backend Configuration" /></p>

<p>When dealing with backends, it is also important to consider how you will put credentials for the application. To ensure you properly
pick the credential make sure you have <a href="/api-management/deployments-and-environments/">configured the environments</a> correctly and also 
provided credentials for the applications created.</p>

<h3 id="response-configuration">Response Configuration</h3>

<p>Response configuration represents how the response is returned for the APIs. The API generally return in JSON or XML based on the 
content type of the request. Once a request is made, you are allowed to identify the response from backend server and depending on
either success or failure, you can customize your messages which will be returned. 
<img src="/staticfiles/api-management/media/response-configure-api.PNG" alt="Response Configure Api" /></p>

<p>Here the response is configured using custom message.</p>

<h2 id="some-real-world-api-use-cases">Some real world API use cases</h2>

<p>As it is always important to look at some of the use cases of APIs such that as a business personnel, you can 
easily understand the proper utilization of an API Management system and also which can help 
you decide the suitable APIs which suits your business need.</p>

<h3 id="api-connecting-on-premise-data-source">API Connecting on premise data source</h3>

<p>Let us suppose you have a legacy database system that collects and collates data from various existing systems,
and remains on a central location as archive providing various validation and data intellegence requirements.

<h3 id="proxy-for-existing-web-api">Proxy for existing Web API</h3>

<p>Proxies help to build an additional layer in between the existing APIs and the server such that you can put a layer 
on the API gateway which will keep track of API requests, manage your own standard authentication, provide custom interfacing
to the backend services, generalize the filters and messages etc.

<h3 id="api-connecting-to-a-static-file">API connecting to a static file</h3>

<p>Files are sometimes less prone to be exposed to the Web as API. Since, if you expose the file
to the external world, the consumers would tend to download or upload the whole file at go, and 
you as a owner of the file would be having less power to change your content.
