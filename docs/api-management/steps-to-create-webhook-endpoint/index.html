<p><strong>Webhooks</strong> are custom callbacks from an application which is generated by the caller and data is pushed to all of the subscribers.Webooks are based on <strong>Publisher-Subscriber</strong> model,where
the publisher will publish something and subscribers thats are only registered for the publisher will listen to it.</p>

<p>A Webhook is simply an event notification where the 
sender will send real time data typically via <code class="highlighter-rouge">HTTP POST</code> to other applications which have registered for that event.
Data that are transferred are typically in <code class="highlighter-rouge">XML</code> or in <code class="highlighter-rouge">JSON</code> or in Form-Encoded format which is to be decided by the provider.</p>

<p>With <strong>APPSeCONECT</strong>, you can create webhook endpoint which are basically handlers for a WebHook that can be used to fetch real time data from an application that has support of webhook 
and that data can then be synced to other apps via APPSeCONNECT Integration Platform in real time using real-time API.</p>
