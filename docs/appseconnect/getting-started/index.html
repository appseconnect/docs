<h2 id="choosing-application">Choosing Application</h2>
<h2 id="1-process-of-choosing-app">(1) Process of Choosing App</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Choose App option enables you to choose app from the list of prebuilt apps on the portal.</li>
  <li>A dialog box appears where you will choose the application and version number from the drop down list. Click <strong>SAVE</strong> to save the app.
<img src="/staticfiles/root/media/ChooseApp_Dialogbox1.png" alt="ChooseApp_Dialogbox1" /></li>
  <li>The list of app you choose gets added and listed in the app section of the orgnaization as shown below:
<img src="/staticfiles/root/media/AppView.png" alt="AppView" /></li>
  <li>Each app has four different component attached to it - <strong>Schema, Adapater, Extension, Functions &amp; Delete</strong>.
<img src="/staticfiles/root/media/AppComponents.png" alt="AppComponents" /></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="appseconnect-schemaentity-">APPSeCONNECT Schema/Entity-</h3>

<p>An entity is defined as an object that has a real-world existence. An entity can be a single thing, person, place, or object. For an e-commerce website, Customer, Order, Invoice etc are entities.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data can be stored about such entities.</li>
  <li>Each schema has its own characteristics or attributes. For example, <code class="highlighter-rouge">customer id</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">address</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">phone number</code> are attributes to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">customer</code> entity. Each customer record in the database serves as an entity item.</li>
  <li>The definition of an entity is called its schema. In other words, the structure of an entity is called its schema.</li>
  <li>If a customer is an entity, then the complete set of the various fields associated with it is called its schema.</li>
</ul>

<p>Schema Image is given below:</p>

<p><img src="/staticfiles/root/media/Schema.png" alt="Schema" /></p>

<h3 id="adapter">Adapter</h3>
<p>Adapters helps in integration with other applications easy. Adapter represents an interface between an APP and APPSeCONNECT. An adapter is a component which connects your app with APPSeCONNECT. 
There are few responsibilities of an adapter which are defined as under:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a credentials view which allows connecting to the respective APP where you want to connect.</li>
  <li>Create Push and Pull method inside the adapter which can send and receive data to and from the application.</li>
  <li>Add additional business behavior with respect to the corresponding app.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Adapter is loaded dynamically by the <strong>Agent</strong> (create link) and calls some specific methods using a fixed contract defined as an interface.</p>

<h3 id="extension">Extension</h3>
<p>Extensions, on the other hand, are the applications which add an extra feature into the E-commerce/ERP platforms making them capable to work with the APPSeCONNECT agent. When an app supports extension, it enables customization.</p>

<h3 id="functions">Functions</h3>
<p>The APPSeCONNECT expression methods are special transformation block used during <code class="highlighter-rouge">mapping</code>. The platform provides a bunch of helper functionalities which can be used during mapping/action filters/rules etc. These functions can either be provided through the platform, or you can write one as an independent Software Vendor. The three different types are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Generic</li>
  <li>Native</li>
  <li>Cloud App Resource</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="delete">Delete</h3>
<p>This button enables to delete selected app from the list.</p>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>ProTip:</strong> Please choose the category correctly because depending on your choice, you might be allowed to add Connectors. This portal do not support connectors between Apps in the same group (As that won’t process any business requirement). For instance, migration jobs from SAP B1 to SAP ECC will not be supported at this time.</p>

<p>The process of Adding New App is present in the subsequent section of the module.</p>

<h2 id="creating-connection--executing-the-touchpoint">Creating Connection &amp; Executing the touchpoint</h2>

<p>The Connection Page of the Cloud Portal is needed for creating connection between two different Applications.</p>

<p>For Example, if you want to create a connection between SAP B1 to Magento 2, you have to come to this page &amp; create the connection. You will also see the existing connection for a particular organization on this page.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Login to portal with the valid details of a user.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the following path: Choose a Project -&gt; Connection</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/staticfiles/root/media/ConnectionDetails.png" alt="ConnectionDetails" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>To find existing Connection, Click Search button. An existing connection opens up</li>
  <li>A typical connection has the following buttons attached to it.</li>
</ol>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>Protip</strong> On clicking the Publish button, all the Touchpoints will be published under the connection. Once a connection has been published, only the Republish button will appear instead of Publish button</p>

<ol>
  <li>All the existing connection of the project will be displayed here. One can activate or deactivate connection by the toggle button.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/staticfiles/root/media/Search-Connection.png" alt="Search-Connection" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>You  can create a new connection by clicking <code class="highlighter-rouge">Create Connection</code> button.</li>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Value Mapping</code> is an important function under touchpoint selection. 
Value mapping is a concept which allows the implementer to configure value mapping specific to the application environment such that when the source value is processed, it will be transferred to the destination value automatically. The Value-Mapping is a way to map the special values which needed to be converted by the applications during transformation.
Details of Value Mapping will come in subsequent section of the document.</p>

<h2 id="configuring-environment---agent-download--cloud-agent-configuration">Configuring Environment - Agent download / Cloud agent configuration</h2>

<p>APPSeCONNECT On-Premise Agent is a hybrid tool that sits on your own server and is configured on cloud and does the actual data synchronization with the help of other concerned adapters while the Cloud agent is a similar tool that performs the same function as the on-premise agent but is present on cloud itself. No server is required to configure or sync using the cloud agent.</p>

<h3 id="environment-setup-of-the-on-premise-agent">Environment setup of the on-premise agent:</h3>

<ol>
