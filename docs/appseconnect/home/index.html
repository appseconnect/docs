<p>APPSeCONNECT is provider of both hybrid and cloud hosted applications which can connect two or more applications irrespective of ERP, Ecommerce or Marketplaces. It is called a hybrid solution because the platform gives a readymade end-to-end service which can be re-configured and downloaded from the APPSeCONNECT ‘cloud’ while all the credentials remain intact in the system’s own premises.</p>

<p>APPSeCONNECT is a platform that support any third party independent software vendor to work and develop connectors. 
APPSeCONNECT installs an Agent on the system’s own premises, which downloads all the configurations from cloud to use them for synchronization operations done on-premise.</p>

<p>The goal of the User Manual is to give a detailed overview of all the features of the product <code class="highlighter-rouge">APPSeCONNECT</code> along with a proper description of the components.</p>

<h1 id="introduction-to-ipaas">Introduction to iPaaS</h1>

<p>Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) is a group of cloud services which enables to execute and control the integration flow via on premises and cloud-based processes, applications and data within individual or across multiple organizations.
In iPaaS the third-party provider provides infrastructure and middleware to manage the data integration on premises and cloud-based processes.</p>

<p>Generally, data integration happens between:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cloud to Cloud Applications: For e.g <code class="highlighter-rouge">Salesforce and Shopify</code></li>
  <li>Cloud to On-Premise / On-Premise to On-Premise Applications (Hybrid): For e.g <code class="highlighter-rouge">Salesforce and SAP Business One</code></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="hybrid-integration-model">Hybrid Integration Model</h1>

<p>Hybrid integration permits on-premises applications to flawlessly integrate with cloud-based applications. Most businesses presently prefer connecting their existing custom and packaged solutions and create a single platform for new services. 
APPSeCONNECT helps enterprises seamlessly connect applications both on-premises and in the cloud, allowing the development of hybrid architecture in which you have control over the data passed between specific applications.</p>

<h1 id="why-is-cloud-integration-necessary">Why is Cloud Integration necessary?</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Easily Accessible solution = Access business data real time from any device and in any location</li>
  <li>Totally Flexible Platform = Simple browser-based management that requires no additional on premise infrastructure</li>
  <li>Scale up or down more Easily = Easy Scaling in terms of app count, user count or both</li>

<h1 id="appseconnect-architecture--usability">APPSeCONNECT Architecture &amp; Usability</h1>

<p>APPSeCONNECT is a generic platform which enables users to deploy, run, and succeed in their integration projects. Using APPSeCONNECT, the users can run their integration processes completely in the cloud without the need to procure any software or the set-up required to operate it.</p>

<p><img src="/staticfiles/root/media/APPSeCONNECT-Architecture.PNG" alt="APPSeCONNECT-Architecture" /></p>

<p>Those who wish to deploy APPSeCONNECT platform, on-premise mode has the elasticity to run their integration processes by deploying the agent(s) behind the firewall, thereby obtaining greater control on where their data resides.
APPSeCONNECT recognizes that many users need their integration processes to communicate with applications that operate behind corporate firewalls for various security and regulatory compliance reasons.
APPSeCONNECT system architecture accommodates to both scenarios: <code class="highlighter-rouge">On cloud integration processes or On Premise behind corporate firewalls</code> to safeguard that corporate data does not get visible to the cloud.</p>

<p>APPSeCONNECT comprises of mainly two components.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cloud/Web</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Agent</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>It is a hybrid solution which can centralize your application(s) communication logic, business logic, and your custom data into configurable endpoints (also called as Touchpoints), which will eventually be downloaded to the APPSeCONNECT thin clients installed on your local server to transform your business data between applications</p>

<p>The server is configured with pre-defined templates which can provide you with a ready-made one-click solution to map basic business requirements with all functional endpoints between apps, while APPSeCONNECT also gives you an option to customize both the pre-defined touchpoints and/or new touchpoints to map your own business processes.</p>

<p>APPSeCONNECT comprises of mainly two components.</p>
