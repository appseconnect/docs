<h3 id="what-is-halt-resume-node">What is halt-resume node?</h3>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">HALT</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">RESUME</code> nodes are used in a combination. We implement <code class="highlighter-rouge">HALT</code> node to halt the execution of the current node and process flow transferred to another node.After completing the transferred flow when the workflow engine will find a <code class="highlighter-rouge">RESUME</code> node then the halted process will start again. For example, we are executing order download process through a workflow but before completing the orders to the destination app we want to run the customer download process and after customer download process completes we want to resume order download process in this scenario we can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">Halt-Resume</code> node. You can apply halt node after the getting data for order download for halting the order download process and transferring the flow to customer download process, next after customer download process completes we can apply a resume node to resume the order download process.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">HALT</code> node in APPSeCONNECT workflow used to halt a process and <code class="highlighter-rouge">RESUME</code> node is used to resume the halted process.</p>

<h3 id="tip">Tip</h3>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">HALT</code> will always link to a Group which has “Get” and only to a Group not to a node.<code class="highlighter-rouge">RESUME</code>  will always come from a Group.</p>

<p>The above mentioned scenario can be implemented using the below workflow.</p>
