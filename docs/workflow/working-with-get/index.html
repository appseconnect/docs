<h3 id="what-is-get-node">What is Get Node?</h3>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">GET</code> node is used for getting data from an application by using the API provided by the application. When we drag a <code class="highlighter-rouge">GET</code> node in the workflow we need to select a touchpoint. For example we have a touchpoint which will add a customer from Shopify (ECommerce) to Sap B1 (ERP). If we add a <code class="highlighter-rouge">GET</code> node in the workflow based on this touchpoint then <code class="highlighter-rouge">GET</code> node will fetch data from Shopify based on the action criteria defined in that touchpoint.</p>

<h3 id="working-principle">Working Principle</h3>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">GET</code> node in APPSeCONNECT workflow is tied to a particular connection and a touchpoint activated in that connection, such that when the node is executed the data from that particular Application is generated 
and responded back to the application workspace.</p>

<p>The highlighted node with red one is an implementation of <code class="highlighter-rouge">GET</code> node.</p>
