<h3 id="working-with-workflow-in-appseconnect">Working with Workflow in APPSeCONNECT</h3>

<p>APPSeCONNECT Workflows are the diagrammatic representations of a business process.</p>

<p>Organizations use workflows to <code class="highlighter-rouge">coordinate tasks and synchronize data between systems,</code> with the ultimate goal of improving organizational efficiency, responsiveness and ease of use.</p>

<p>The workflow management screen will allow to search, filter, create and edit workflows.</p>

<p>An implementer can ensure that all the projects are listed on a single page showing its various status and allowing to change status by reading this document.</p>
