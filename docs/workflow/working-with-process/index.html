<h3 id="what-is-process-node">What is Process Node?</h3>
<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">PROCESS</code> node is used for transforming data from one format to another format based on the mapping logic specified for that touchpoint. When we drag a process node in the workflow we need to select a touchpoint. For example, we have a touchpoint which will add a customer from Shopify (ECommerce) to Sap B1 (ERP), so for adding data to SAP B1, we need to convert Shopify data to SAP B1 format. <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROCESS</code> node will do that work depending on the transformation logic written in the touchpoint.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">PROCESS</code> node in APPSeCONNECT workflow is tied to a particular connection and a touchpoint activated in that connection, such that when the node is executed the data will be transformed base on touchpoint mapping logic.</p>

<p>The highlighted node with red one is an implementation of <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROCESS</code> node.</p>
