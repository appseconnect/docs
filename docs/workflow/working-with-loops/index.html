<h3 id="what-is-loop-node">What is Loop Node?</h3>
<p>In APPSeCONNECT Workflow using a Self-loop, we can repeatedly execute an individual node without affecting the other nodes that are linked with it. If we draw a self-loop in GET element in Workflow it will ask for the no of times it will be executed. Letâ€™s take a scenario where touchpoint associated with the GET node can fetch 10 records at a time but I want to fetch a minimum of 50 unsynced data at a time if it is available. Here I can implement a self-loop with 5 occurrences.If I want to fetch all unsynced data then we can choose the until data available option.</p>
