    app shows exhausted`.

* Improper validation of the application in the Agent (Cloud/On-Premise)
* Wrong credentials provided or the base URL provided for the application could be wrong

Solution: Usually while fetching the data through POSTMAN, users must go through the authorization process of the application 
for validating the app in POSTMAN. 

This error could occur only when the Access Token has not been generated by POSTMAN or the generated Access Token has expired. 

To troubleshoot this error, user/implementor needs to study the API documentation for the application and authorize the 
application in postman accordingly. 

## Troubleshooting Scenario 4

Solution: Auth 2.0 supported application needs to generate Access Token, for the credentials to get authorize. This token 
has a threshold time for it to remain active. Once it gets inactive, this error is displayed.

in the agent. Once validated, user needs to regenerate the access token by click on the `Generate Token` button.
