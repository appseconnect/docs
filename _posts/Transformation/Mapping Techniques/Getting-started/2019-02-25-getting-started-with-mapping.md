Getting started section of the mapping will help you to understand the main areas you should be familiar with 
before starting doing the transformation process. 

## What is Mapping

`Mapping` triggers the transformation process between the Source and the Destination Applications. 
Source and destination schemas are mapped in the Transform section of the touchpoint. 

It is important to note that a touchpoint caters to a particular schema or an entity. A touchpoint maps the source schema 
for a particular action with the destination schema, thus facilitating the transfer of information between the schemas. The 
attributes of the schema may vary for different applications. Also, the data arriving from the source application may have a 
different format than the destination application. To resolve the issues that may arise, you deploy Mapping. 

Mapping of a touchpoint is required to define which attributes of the target schema correspond to those of the source schema.  
In this effort, you write the logic that facilitates this transformation. Attribute mapping thus forms the main part of 
transforming data from one format to another. 

This document will help you to know about the `different types of Mapping` done in APPSeCONNECT portal for easy
data transformation and smooth data integration between the applications.

## Structure of Mapping

The basic structure of mapping contains three main fields:
* Transformation
* Root Variable
* Tracking

### Transformation

This is the field where the attributes corresponding to the schema are mapped. This is 
also the place where the logic behind the transformation is implemented such that the 
integration proceeds uninterrupted. The various attributes that may be linked to the 
integration are declared here along with their child fields.

### Root Variable

To facilitate touchpoint mapping, you require root variables that store the data to be 
used later in the transformation process. Root variables can be used for different 
purposes. They are used for storing data returned from an AppResource function, 
to store values returned from complex XPath expression or to store a chunk of XML
data which you can use later in the mapping. A root variable may be used several 
times for data while setting up the transformation and is not entity item specific.

Once a root variable has been declared it can be used for the transformation of 
each and every item. The different root variables that may be required are defined 
in this section.

### Tracking

As the name suggests,`tracking` may be used to study the data synchronization from the source application to the destination application. 
Tracking provides an opportunity to include more details with the source schema items when they are being 
transferred to the destination schema.

When you run a touchpoint, you can see the various data being transferred in the re-sync 
bucket along with the status of the sync. The data belongs to a schema and thus, 
has a schema id. The re-sync bucket only enlists each entity item by their entity id. 

If you require to include more attributes to the schema item while tracking, 
this can be done by adding the desired `attribute to Tracking`. The user can thus 
have a better understanding of the information being transferred, thus making the sync 
process even more user-friendly.

For example, if you are transferring customer records from the source to the destination application, the on-premise agent would only 
display the `source id`, which in this case, is the `customer id`. If you add more fields, say `customer name`, `customer phone` etc., 
it would be easier for the user to understand the data that has been transferred.

## Basics of Attribute Mapping
You need to understand the XML and XPath types along with Attribute Mapping
process. This section will also elaborate on the APPSeCONNECT Mapping types.
