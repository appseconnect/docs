This document will guide you through the TRANSFORMATION functionality in APPSeCONNECT portal. **TRANSFORMATION** is the field where the corresponding to the schema are mapped. 
This is also the place where the logic behind the transformation is implemented such that the integration proceeds uninterrupted.

**What is Transformation**

Every touchpoint has a resultant XSLT which converts the source XML format into the destination XML. 
This XSLT is created under the Transformation field. If you check the XSLT code you would see that it has a root node
which refers to the schema, the attributes which exist as child nodes which in turn can have further fields extending the branch.

Thus the transformation has a hierarchical structure. Let us see the Transformation process with the
 **Business Partner Add touchpoint in the connection Magento2 to SAP**.

On expanding the Transformation we see the `For-Each Loop` there.

**Working with Transformation**

For-Each-Loop works exactly like the For-Loop in general Programming language. Every time the touchpoint is run 
you have data coming on from the source schema which requires to be transformed individually such that it matches 
the format of the destination schema.

For example: When a **customer add** touchpoint is executed, records of several customers are fetched from the source app. 
So the same logic for transformation is required to be deployed several times over. Instead of writing the same
transformation several times over a loop is set up.  Whenever there is a customer record that requires to be transformed
the loop gets executed.

The `for-each loop` requires us to define an X-path. The X-path is the course of nodes in the generated XSLT through which the loop would progress

![For-Each-Loop](/staticfiles/api-management/media/For-Each-Loop.png)
For the for-each loop, you have provided the X-path as ‘//items/item’. Here the first / refers to the parent node, 
the /items is the schema node and /item refers to each child node under the /items node, i.e. each schema item. 
Thus, you are directing each schema item to the for-loop. By mapping the *for-each-loop* you are providing 
the information as to which items must be executed.

If you expand the For-each loop, you can see **oBusinessPartners** and **Condition**.


oBusinessPartners is an object, that is used to send data to the target application. For different touchpoints
we would see that the object is different. For the touchpoint Sales Order Add, the object is oOrders
for Simple Product Add it is oItems and so on.

If you expand the object oBusinessPartners, you can see the several attributes listed under it. 
Each attribute has separate information about the entity it belongs to.

Each of these attributes will contain different information about the customer record. 
BPAddresses will contain the addresses of the customer, BPPaymentMethods contains the payment methods 
available to the customer, ContactEmployees contains the information about the contact persons of the 
customer and so on.

The highlighted fields are discussed below.

Different objects would have different attributes.

If you go ahead and expand BusinessPartners you can see the following view

![Business-Partner](/staticfiles/api-management/media/Business-Partner.png)

There are two elements listed under it Row and Variable. The row is the set of all fields that are a part of the attribute.
Variable allows us to add a variable that could be used to store a value and use for this particular attribute.

If we expand any other attribute, we can see that the structure is the same.

![Attribute-Structure](/staticfiles/api-management/media/Attribute-Structure.png)

If you click on the row, you can see the various fields that are a part of this attribute.

![Attribute-Fields](/staticfiles/api-management/media/Attribute-Fields.png)

Each of these fields is mapped with the corresponding fields of the source schema.

**Root entity variable**

For a particular mapping, root entity refers to the schema/entity which it is used to map. 
For example, for the object oBusinessPartners, the customer is the root entity.

A root entity variable is a variable that has a value specific to every iteration. 
Every entity item has this variable declared with it such that it is present in every iteration 
and has a different value for every schema item.

It is interesting to note that the root entity variable can be used several times in different 
parts of the transformation underlying in the touchpoint. Its value, however, will be different 
for every iteration.

**Protip** Query params and Root Entity variable are present in every object, irrespective of the touchpoint they belong to.
