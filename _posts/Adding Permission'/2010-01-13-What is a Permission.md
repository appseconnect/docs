# Handling Permission

Permission is a technique of giving access to users on projects or services. After getting permission on a project or a service, the user would be able to manage the resources without requiring us to be involved on a change. 

## Adding permission to a project
Adding permission to accounts is sometimes necessary when you require an external agent to access a specific account. APPSeCONNECT by default hides all the projects in which your role does not have permission to. Based on that, you can allow some third-party users or partners to have access to the projects. Follow the steps to create a new project: 

### Steps


1. Open any *project*, and click on permission.
2. On the organization assignment page, choose the user and activate the `account`. 
3. Add the user from the list of users in the popup.
4. Click `Save` to commit changes. 

When the user is assigned to the project, the project is accessible to that particular user from his/her login. 


## Adding permission to an Application

Adding permission to the app is sometimes necessary when you require an external **ISV** to access a specific application. APPSeCONNECT by default hides all the apps in which your role does not have permission to. Based on that, you can allow some third-party users or partners to have access to the apps.

### Steps

1. Open an app, and click on permission.
2. On the organization assignment page, choose the user and activate the account. 
3. Add the user from the list of users in the popup.
4. Click `Save` to commit changes.

When the user is assigned to the project, the project is accessible to that particular user.

## Request permission to a resource

As a user, you can request the permission for a particular feature if you get the 403 error at the time of execution.

* Once you request permission.
* Super-admin will see the requests in the dash-board(Base).
* Base on your role or situation he/she might accept/decline the request.
* You will be notified in any case.
