## Designer

This section will enable the user to design their business specific integration flows using their selected packages. You can easily create and design your integration flows using 
Workflows and Processflows. Below are the gist that provides you with the informations of Workflow and processflow.

![Designer1](\staticfiles\root\media\designer1.PNG)

### Workflows

`Workflow management` is group of instructions to the integration service in APPSeCONNECT.
APPSeCONNECT workflow application can be considered as a strong feature that uses the software to either partially or entirely automate a complex business process. Workflow is a concept that describes how process in business divides work activities into distinct roles, task, procedures and rules.

To know more about Workflow Management, [Click here](/workflow/overview/).

### Processflows

`Processflows` are the advanced workflows that enables you to design node specific flows which brings the ability to cater unique business process.
processflow is enabled with an advanced monitoring system that provides you with every detailed logs for troubleshooting purpose for each of your failed deployments and syncs. Also, processflow is enables with a Packaging system that enables the user to zip design Processflows into packages
that enables you to share and install in other organisations.

To know more about the Processflows, [Click Here](/processflow/overview-of-processflow/)

## Deploy

This section will allow you to work with your **ENVIRONMENTS** either On-Premise or Hosted. You can perform multiple deployment functionalities that will help you setting up your environments.

![Deploy1](\staticfiles\root\media\deploy1.PNG)

### Environment

[Environment](https://docs.appseconnect.com/getting%20started/configurations-for-integration/#configuring-environment---agent-download--cloud-agent-configuration) page lists the devices that have access to the project that the customer is working on. 

## Manage

This section will allow you to manage the applications, connection, rules and other modules of APPSeCONNECT. Below are the modules
that will be available to you under the **MANAGE** section.

![manage1](\staticfiles\root\media\manage1.PNG)


### Users

 Users is one of the main feature of APPSeCONNECT portal as this control over the access that a user has. Depending on the role of the user, the menu panel of the portal is customized such that the user can use the functionalities depending on the role allotted to him.

 * We can add multiple users to a particular project on the cloud portal by clicking on 'Users'. 
 * Each user will have different levels to the portal depending on the role allotted to them. 
 * Depending on the role, different users have different levels of permission to access the various features.
 * These roles are Organisation Admin, Implementer, Partner etc.

**Protip** According to the present scope of understanding, there you will encounter 2 main roles as given below: 
{:.notice--info} 

(a) **External Implementer:** In APPSeCONNECT, an external implementer is a user who sets up the integration solution, depending on the customer's requirement. An implementer can modify a project once it has 
    been created by the Admin. He or she can edit the project and its status. An external implementer has access to specific projects.

(b) **Organisation Admin:** The access level of the customer is called the 'Organisation Admin'. He or she can add/ choose apps. Create connections and setup workflows but he or she cannot setup roles, regulate the control of users, or bring about any configurational changes.

A company can have multiple user for an organisation in APPSeCONNECT project. Every project in APPSeCONNECT
has a single user `organisation owner` by default, implementers/users of APPSeCONNECT can add multiple 
users to an organisation for providing multiple access to its organisation users assigning different roles 
to each.

The roles that can be provided to each user are:  
a.	Connection Manager  
b.	Organization Admin  

#### Prerequisite for adding a User

* There should be an organisation present with APPSeCONNECT.
* User being added should not be a user for a different organisation. 

#### Steps to add USER to an organisation

1) Login to the APPSeCONNECT Portal and navigate to the USER module under Manage.
2) By default, the interface would be of the tab Client Users. By default, APPSeCONNECT user would view the interface of the tab Client Users. 

**Note: The tab Partners will not have any view unless an organization has any requirements for partners.**

3)	For a fresh organisation, only the organisation owner will be displayed as the user in the user list. Click on the Add User button, to add more user to an organisation.
![Useradd1](\staticfiles\root\media\useradd1.PNG)

values to the application integration, such that when the source and destination application is integrated, the value in source application can easily be integrated with its value in destination 
application, corresponding to its field.

### Rules

APPSeCONNECT Rule listing enables you to perform ACTIONS like (raising a support ticket or sending an email) based on the type of events encountered during agent execution such as - `Execution Failure, Execution Start, Execution End`, via Rule Engine. 

During Agent execution, if some events are encountered such as *Application Crash*, automatically the Rule which you have defined on Application Crash will be triggered and it will perform the associated Action with that Rule.
You can also define additional criteria for triggering the Rule and performing the actions. 

In that case whenever the event will occur it will also check if the additional criteria are matched or not. If the additional criteria are matched then only the [Rule](https://docs.appseconnect.com/rule/overview-of-rule/) will be triggered.
