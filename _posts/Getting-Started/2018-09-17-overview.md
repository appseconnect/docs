APPSeCONNECT is provider of both hybrid and cloud hosted applications which can connect two or more applications irrespective of ERP, Ecommerce or Marketplaces. It is called a hybrid solution because the platform gives a readymade end-to-end service which can be re-configured and downloaded from the `APPSeCONNECT Cloud` while all the credentials remain intact in the systems own premise. 

APPSeCONNECT is a platform that support any third party independent software vendor to work and develop connectors. 
APPSeCONNECT installs an Agent on the system's own premises, which downloads all the configurations from cloud to use them for synchronization operations done on-premise. 

The goal of the User Manual is to give a detailed overview of all the features of the product `APPSeCONNECT` along with a proper description of the components.

## Introduction to iPaaS

Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) is a group of cloud services which enables to execute and control the integration flow via on premises and cloud-based processes, applications and data within individual or across multiple organizations.
In iPaaS the third-party provider, gives infrastructure and middleware to manage the data integration on premises and cloud-based processes.

Generally Data integration happens between:

* Cloud to Cloud Applications: For e.g `Salesforce and Shopify`
* Cloud to On-Premise / On-Premise to On-Premise Applications (Hybrid): For e.g `Salesforce and SAP Business One`


## Hybrid Integration Model

Hybrid integration permits on-premises applications to flawlessly integrate with On-Premises Applications and as well cloud-based 
applications. The Hybrid Integration Model also lets the Cloud Based Application to Integrate with similar Cloud Based 
Applications as well.  Therefore, most businesses presently prefer connecting their existing custom and packaged solutions and 
create a single platform for new services. APPSeCONNECT helps enterprises seamlessly connect applications both on-premises and 
in the cloud, allowing the development of hybrid architecture in which you have control over the data passed between specific applications.

## Why is Cloud Integration necessary?

* Easily Accessible solution = Access business data real time from any device and in any location 
* Totally Flexible Platform = Simple browser-based management that requires no additional on premise infrastructure
* Scale up or down more Easily = Easy Scaling in terms of app count, user count or both

## APPSeCONNECT Architecture & Usability

Those who wish to deploy APPSeCONNECT platform, on-premise mode has the elasticity to run their integration processes by deploying the agent(s) behind the firewall, thereby obtaining greater control on where their data resides.
APPSeCONNECT recognizes that many users need their integration processes to communicate with applications that operate behind corporate firewalls for various security and regulatory compliance reasons.
APPSeCONNECT system architecture accommodates to both scenarios: `On cloud integration processes or On Premise behind corporate firewalls` to safeguard that corporate data does not get visible to the cloud.

APPSeCONNECT comprises of mainly two components.
* **Cloud/Web**
* **Agent**

It is a hybrid solution which can centralize your application(s) communication logic, business logic, and your custom data into configurable endpoints (also called as Touchpoints), 
which will eventually be downloaded to the APPSeCONNECT thin clients installed on your local server to transform your business data between applications

The server is configured with pre-defined templates which can provide you with a ready-made one-click solution to map basic business requirements with all functional endpoints between apps, 
while APPSeCONNECT also gives you an option to customize both the pre-defined touchpoints and/or new touchpoints to map your own business processes.

APPSeCONNECT Implementation is also categorized into two types.

* **Cloud Implementation**
* **Hybrid Implementation**
