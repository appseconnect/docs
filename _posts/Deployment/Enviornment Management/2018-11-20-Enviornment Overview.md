* Environment is the area in the AEC portal where an user can configure and control the agents that are being used for that organisation. 

* The Environment  in the AEC Portal supports two types of agents that is the On-Premise Agent
and The Cloud Agent which are configured and created. 

|Hybrid Integration|Cloud Integration|
|---|---|
|The hybrid model allows the customer to configure integration settings on the cloud portal and download and install the APPSeCONNECT on-premise agent in their own infrastructure. So, the data transfer between applications happen within the company(s) own network|The cloud integration model allows the customer to integrate two or more cloud applications, that is, applications which are available via the web as a service. There is no need to download and install any software in the company(s) system and the entire integration process and data exchange work through the APPSeCONNECT cloud-agent in the web portal|


* There are multiple activites whch can be executed in the Enviornment section.  The user can **Block, Unblock, Deploy Configuration, 
  Deploy Adapter** and do agent specific settings from the Environment Section in the Cloud AEC Portal.
