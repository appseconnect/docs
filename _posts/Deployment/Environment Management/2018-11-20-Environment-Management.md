**NOTE:The time displayed in last deployed log is similar to the UTC time set for the organization [timezone]()**

## Environment View for Old Agents

APPSeCONNECT License management & environment management is equipped with the full supportability of old agents. However, old agent users are 
restricted from viewing the environment details which is available on for latest agents. Users need to update the old agent for viewing the 
details of the environment. 

Old agent will support the complete functionality of the integration process. Old Agent user shall view the environment as given below:
![old-environment1](/staticfiles/deployment/media/RevampedEnv/old-environment1.png)

_**Note: Users having On Premise agents upto **4.3.0.12** will be considered as Old Agents.**_

The UI will have three buttons:
* Deploy Configuration: Any changes or modifications made in the portal will be deployed to the OP agent for the sync process when deployed the configurations from the portal. 
* Agent Settings: This page has three tabs that configures the setting for the environment.  
  (a)Log Settings: Log settings captures the details of the Sync process.    
  (b)Real Time Settings: Real Time settings is required when working with Real Time touchpoints using [Webhooks](/api-management/steps-to-create-webhook-endpoint/) of the API Management.  
  (c)Resync Settings: Users can enable/disable the Autosync feature of the OP agent in the Resync Settings tab.  

**Note: Old Agent in Detached mode, will not be able to deploy any configuration to the corresponding agent.**
 
### Working with the Agent Settings Panel in Old Agent

Environments needs to be configured for the generation of the sync logs, autosync activation and Realtime settings configuration. Users need to 
configure the panel accordingly for detailed output and process.

![old-environment2](/staticfiles/deployment/media/RevampedEnv/old-environment2.png)

**Note: (a) Agent status for old agents will be displayed in RED but will have the complete functionality of an Active Agent.  
        (b) Users can detach/attach the agents for detaching/attaching the agent**. 

**ProTip:** (1) Agent needs to be dissociated first from the portal, before reassigning the same license key.   
            (2) APPSeCONNECT [License Management](/license%20management/license-management/) is compatible even with older versions of the agent.
{: .notice--info}

**Log Settings:** Log settings captures the severity details of the logs that are generated. User can filter accordingly as per severity basis of the logs. 
The page captures the following operations:
