If the user wants to perform some ACTIONS based on the type 
of events encountered during agent execution such as - Execution Failure, Application Crash, Execution Start, 
execution end, that can be done using APPSeCONNECT Rules. 

During an occurrence of any event as such as application crash, the rule against that event 
if created and its action associated with the rule, will be triggered automatically.


## Types of Rules

Presently rules are categorized into two types:

1.	Pre-Configured Rules: These are prebuilt and prepackaged rules provided by the APPSeCONNECT and can be activated and used
    by the user. To know more,read [Choose Rule Button](/rule/choose-rule/).     
2.	Default Rules: These rules are configured by the APPSeCONNECT itself, and will automatically be 
    triggered if any events occurred according to its criteria.   
    Few example are [Defaut Rule for Morning Report](/rule/default-rule-for-morning-report/).
