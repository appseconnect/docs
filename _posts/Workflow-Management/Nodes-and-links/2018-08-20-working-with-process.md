`PROCESS` node is used for transforming data from one format to another format based on the mapping logic specified for that touchpoint. When we drag a process node in the workflow we need to select a touchpoint. For example, we have a touchpoint which will add a customer from Shopify (ECommerce) to Sap B1 (ERP), so for adding data to SAP B1, we need to convert Shopify data to SAP B1 format. `PROCESS` node will do that work depending on the transformation logic written in the touchpoint.

### Working Principle

`PROCESS` node in APPSeCONNECT workflow is tied to a particular connection and a touchpoint activated in that connection, such that when the node is executed the data will be transformed base on touchpoint mapping logic.

The highlighted node with red one is an implementation of `PROCESS` node.

Below picture is an example of mapping based on which data transformation will be performed by the `PROCESS` node.
