### Why do you need element in Workflow?

Workflow Elements is a easy to use solution for APPSeCONNECT that provides you the tool to build workflow in ways you never thought possible.
Like other category of diagrams, elements help you visualize what is going on and thereby help understand a process, 
and perhaps also find bottlenecks, and other less-obvious features within it. 


### Element Type of Workflow 

|Action Name|Description|
|---|--------|
|[Get](/workflow/working-with-get/)|GET node is used for getting data from an application by using the API provided by the application.|
|[Process](/workflow/working-with-process/)|PROCESS node is used for transforming data from one format to another format based on the mapping logic specified for that touchpoint. |
|[Post](/workflow/working-with-post/)|POST node is used for pushing data to an application based on the API provided by the application.|
|[Halt-Resume](/workflow/working-with-halt-resume/)|HALT and RESUME nodes are used in a combination. We implement HALT node to halt the execution of the current node and process flow transferred to another node.|
|[Delay](/workflow/working-with-delay/)|DELAY node is used to delay or stop an execution flow for a specific period. |

These activities have some scope and limitations which are applied to ensure limiting critical resources.
