## Working with Workflow in APPSeCONNECT

 APPSeCONNECT Workflows are the diagrammatic representations of a business process.  

 Organizations use workflows to `coordinate tasks and synchronize data between systems,` with the ultimate goal of improving organizational efficiency, responsiveness and ease of use.

 The workflow management screen will allow to search, filter, create and edit workflows.

 An implementer can ensure that all the projects are listed on a single page showing its various status and allowing to change status by reading this document.

 1. Log in to the APPSeCONNECT Portal
 2. Now choose a `Project -> Designer > Workflows` section under Account and a new page will open.
