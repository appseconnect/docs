Workflow in APPSeCONNECT provides integration solution which helps any business to execute integration flow of data between two or more applications. 
An implementer can now be able to use the `CHOOSE WORKFLOW` feature in the APPSeCONNECT Portal. This document will help the implementer to go through the feature in detail.

## Usability of Choosing Workflow feature

* This Feature lists you all the pre-packaged workflows.
* You can view existing workflows or can create workflow in your workflow panel.
* Choose a pre-packaged  workflow, and a Connection specific request pops-up in case of multiple existing pre-packaged App Connection.

## Steps to choosing Workflow in your workpanel

for which connection you want the workflow to get activated.
