### Use Case Name  
Workflow showing task configuration with  splitter rule

### Brief Description 
 
This workflow enables the user to add business partner (in Magento 2) and enable the execution and data sync between Magento 2 & SAP B1 with [Splitter](/workflow/working-with-splitter/) node. 
The business partner touchpoint is used to fetch multiple customers, SPLITTER is used after GET Node and Merger is used after PROCESS. 

In this case the multiple customer would be fetched and will be split. A self-loop is implemented on PROCESS node which will be executed as per the number of datas present. MERGER will merge all the data in a batch of 2 and will post the data.

For Example: 20 Business Partner will be merged into a batch of 2 which means it will be merged into 10 Packets. 
Similarly if there are 4 data(s) they will be merged in to 2 and will be generating 2 Packets each.


This workflow allows task configuration with data splitting.
