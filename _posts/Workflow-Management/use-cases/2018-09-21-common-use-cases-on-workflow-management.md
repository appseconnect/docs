Workflow signifies the definition, execution, and automation of business processes where tasks and information are passed from one touchpoint to another for action, according to a set of procedural rules.

Organizations use Workflows to coordinate tasks and synchronize data between systems, with the ultimate goal of improving organizational efficiency, responsiveness and ease of use.
