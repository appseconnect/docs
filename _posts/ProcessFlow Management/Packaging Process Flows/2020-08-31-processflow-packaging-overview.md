Zipping up of multiple files in packages makes it easy to reuse and share 
with different users.  
 
Huge set of files can easily be zipped and packaged for sharing making 
collaborations easy. Process Flow is an advanced concept and with its 
latest packaging technique, you can easily bundle multiple process flows 
within packages and can share with different organisation users which 
diminishes the time for creating mapping an identical process flow in a 
different organisation.
