Packaging of process flows have enabled the users to zip multiple process flows. The main goal to create packages was to share with other organisations. As we encourage the concept of Citizen Integrators, so package sharing is an idea concept of sharing process with one organisation to another.
Sharing packages will not only save time, but will also reduce the efforts of creating, designing and mapping process flows that is already created in some other organisation.
This document will enable you to initate sharing packages from one organisation to another.

## Prerequisites
