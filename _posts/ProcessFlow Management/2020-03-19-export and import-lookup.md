Repositories in APPSeCONNECT provides the user to create and manage Lookup types in form of tables for the organisation. 
As APPSeCONNECT has the approach to provide simpler usability to the users of the platform, 
therefore Repositories in APPSeCONNECT has been implemented with the feature of Import & Export of 
Reference tables that reduces the manual work of the table creation.

The Lookup Repository is implemented with a format that is followed while 
importing and exporting the Lookups. 

The format for the lookups is given below with an example:

  stored inside the Repository Collection. For Ex: Country, Tax, Freight, PriceLists etc. 
* Description: Needs to provide the description of the Lookup.
* Source: The Source value of the lookup type needs to be provided.
* Destination: The destination value of the lookup type needs to be provided.

Users can Import & Export lookups both from the [Repository Collection & Reference Table]()
