APPSeCONNECT processflows suite features an extensive interface that provide the ability to easily create digital maps 
to make out robust processflows. The drag-and-drop interface is easy to use by any citizen integrator. With the aid of 
processflow feature, users can now graphically organize, create and view the data flow of a process thereby enabling 
customers to design integration anytime and anywhere with the help of our cloud portal. Thus, processflow supports 
tailored business rules, email templates, automation flows and monitoring process. You can now build and deploy 
processflows, from simple to sophisticated, through a modern, native-cloud platform.

## Benefits of using Processflows

STREAMLINE AND AUTOMATE COMPLEX BUSINESS PROCESSES
* Provide expertise and team collaboration to sell more effectively.
* Enables quick decision making & Learn from inefficiencies
* Eliminates Manual work & reduces human error

CUSTOMIZE AND EXTEND BEST PRACTICES
* Build customized business-related flows and templates to use it across departments for best practices.
* Zero coding experience needed; build and share complex flows using visual designer

UNINTERRUPTEDLY IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY
* Processflow lets end users and admins model and maintain business processes using a visual graphical tool without coding.
* It encapsulates complex and multistep flows to automate and streamline business processes.

## Navigating to Processflows

Navigate to the Designer > processflows. The processflow listing page appears. The list of the folders in the listing page would available on the left pane of the page. 
By default, an organisation would have the following folders created `processflow , Installed processflow , Package Library , Trash` Folder.

## Processflow Modules

|Modules| Description|  
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------|           
|[Processflow Designer Page](/processflow/designer-processflow/) | This page will let the users, create new processflows for their business processes|      
|[Creating processflow](/processflow/creating-processflow/) |This section of the documentation will guide the user with the process of Creating & Saving new processflows|   
|[Copy ProcessFlows](/processflow/copy-processflow/)|This will enable you to copy your designed processflows for creating and storing a backup file of your configured processflow.|
|[Deploying and Excecuting processflow](/processflow/deploying-and-executing-processfloww/) | This section enables the user to deploy the new or saved processflow to the environment in order to execute the integration process|          
|[Undeploying processflow](/processflow/deploying-and-executing-processfloww/#undeploy-process-flow-from-environment) | This section enables the user to undeploy a deployed process from the environment|    
|[Redeploying processflow](/processflow/redeploying-processflow/) | Redeploying processflow functionality allows you to re-deploy an existing processflows (deployed/deployed and executed) to the same environment in order to make any changes and execute the integration process|      
|[Snapshot processflow](/processflow/snapshot-processflow/) | This section of the documentation will guide the user about viewing snapshot of the created processflow|    
|[Processflow Packaging](/processflow/processflow-packaging-overview/)| This will enable you to create and install & Reinstall packages containing processflows. You can share your created packages to other organisation when required also you will be able to install incoming packages shared to you.|
|[Export & Import Lookup](/processflow/export-and-import-lookup/) | Repositories in APPSeCONNECT has been implemented with the feature of Import & Export of Reference tables that reduces the manual work of the table creation|        
|[Implemeting Lookup in Mapping](/processflow/implementing-lookup-in-mapping/) | Once the Collection and the Reference tables are created, users can implement those lookups in the attribute mapping for the sync process|   
|[Creating Lookup Repository Master Data](/processflow/Lookup-repository-masterdata/) | Repositories in APPSeCONNECT provides the user to create and manage Lookup types in form of tables for the organisation|        
|[Mapper Node](/processflow/working-with-mapper/) | processflow designer inteface gives you the space to design your business flow and do the node configurations of the applications and trasformation activities all in one go|
