APPSeCONNECT processflows suite features an extensive interface that provide the ability to easily create digital maps 
to make out robust processflows. The drag-and-drop interface is easy to use by any citizen integrator. With the aid of 
processflow feature, users can now graphically organize, create and view the data flow of a process thereby enabling 
customers to design integration anytime and anywhere with the help of our cloud portal. Thus, processflow supports 
tailored business rules, email templates, automation flows and monitoring process. You can now build and deploy 
processflows, from simple to sophisticated, through a modern, native-cloud platform.

## Benefits of using processflows

STREAMLINE AND AUTOMATE COMPLEX BUSINESS PROCESSES
* Provide expertise and team collaboration to sell more effectively.
* Enables quick decision making & Learn from inefficiencies
* Eliminates Manual work & reduces human error

CUSTOMIZE AND EXTEND BEST PRACTICES
* Build customized business-related flows and templates to use it across departments for best practices.
* Zero coding experience needed; build and share complex flows using visual designer

UNINTERRUPTEDLY IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY
* processflow lets end users and admins model and maintain business processes using a visual graphical tool without coding.
* It encapsulates complex and multistep flows to automate and streamline business processes.

## Navigating to processflows

Navigate to the Designer > processflows. The processflow listing page appears. The list of the folders in the listing page would available on the left pane of the page. 
By default, an organisation would have the following folders created `processflow , Installed processflow , Package Library , Trash` Folder.
