Implementing User Specific Business Integrations often requires usage of User Defined Appresource Functions that enables you to provide customized expressions as per the requirement.
Application Adapters are equipped of handling these functions to perform definite tasks.

With ProcessFlow, you will now be able to create user defined Cloud Appresource function from [ProcessFlow Designer](/processflow/designer-processflow/) Page. Given below are the steps and Prerequisites to create 
User Defined Appresource Functions.

## Prerequisites

Implementing User Defined Appresource Functions requires no Prerequisites. You can straight away Login to the portal and create your required functions from the Designer Page.
Follow the steps below to create the user Defined Cloud Appresource Functions.

## Navigating to User Defined Functions

1) Login to the Portal and Navigate to the [ProcessFlow Designer](/processflow/designer-processflow/) Page.

2) Click on the Functions Icon available in Header Panel of the designer page.

For more information on the Code Editor, Visit [UDF Code Editor and Validation]().

**Note:**

- You can also create your Cloud Appresource Functions from the mapper node. For more information on that steps, [click here](/processflow/cloud-appresource-functions/).
- All the created functions irrespective of the areas, the functions will be listed on the UDF Listing Window. For more details on the Listing page, [Click Here](/processflow/Listing-Editing-user-defined-functions/).
