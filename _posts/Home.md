APPSeCONNECT is a cloud-based hybrid solution which maps business processes of ERP with eCommerce / Marketplaces or CRM Systems. It is called a hybrid solution because the platform gives a readymade end-to-end service which can be re-configured and downloaded from the APPSeCONNECT 'cloud'  while all the credentials remain intact in the system's own premises. 
APPSeCONNECT is developed as a platform where an ISV partner can also work together with APPSeCONNECT and develop the cloud configurations for the Apps which it does not support and can work seamlessly together with Apps which it does. APPSeCONNECT installs an Agent on the system's own premises, which downloads all the configurations from cloud to use them for synchronization operations done on-premise.

# Introduction to IPAAS

Integration Platform as a Service (IPPAS) is a group of cloud services which enables to execute and control the integration flows via on premises and cloud-based processes, applications and data within individual or across multiple organizations.
In IPPAS the third-party provider provides infrastructure and middleware to manage the data integration on premises and cloud-based processes.
Generally, data integration happens between:

Cloud to Cloud Applications: For e.g Salesforce and Shopify
Cloud to On-Premise / On-Premise to On-Premise Applications (Hybrid): For e.g Salesforce and SAP Business One

# Hybrid Integration Model

Hybrid integration permits on-premises applications to flawlessly integrate with cloud-based applications. Most businesses presently prefer connecting their existing custom and packaged solutions and create a single platform for new services. 
APPSeCONNECT helps enterprises seamlessly connect applications both on-premises and in the cloud, allowing the development of hybrid architecture in which you have control over the data passed between specific applications.

# App se Connect Architecture & Usability

APPSeCONNECT is a generic platform which enables users to deploy, run, and succeed in their integration projects. Using APPSeCONNECT, the users can run their integration processes completely in the cloud without the need to procure any software or the set-up required to operate it. 

Those who wish to deploy APPSeCONNECT platform, on-premise mode has the elasticity to run their integration processes by deploying the agent(s) behind the firewall, thereby obtaining greater control on where their data resides.

APPSeCONNECT recognizes that many users need their integration processes to communicate with applications that operate behind corporate firewalls for various security and regulatory compliance reasons.
APPSeCONNECT system architecture accommodates to both scenarios: On cloud integration processes or On Premise behind corporate firewalls to safeguard that corporate data does not get visible to the cloud.

APPSeCONNECT comprises of mainly two components.
* Cloud/Web
