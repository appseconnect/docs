* Revision History: User will be able to view the Revision History button only when the workflow has been saved for revision. Workflows available in Revision History can be restored by user as per the requirement.
* Snapshot: User can view Snapshot details of the workflow, executed.
* Save: Once the workflow is designed, user can save the following workflow for later use. After the saving of the workflow, any changes done here after will be auto-saved every 30 seconds automatically.
* Save Revision: User can now maintain the history of changes done for the workflows. Users/implementers can restore the saved history anytime as per the need.
On saving a new revision of a workflow, users will get an option to add comments for the changes made in that revision.
* Deploy: The designed workflow will be deployed to the primary environment for the execution purpose.

Users/Implementers can view the Back to Workflows button that will navigate back to the listing page.
