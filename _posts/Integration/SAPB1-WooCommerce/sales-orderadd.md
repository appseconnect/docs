## Lookup Mapping

For the sync process of the Sales Order Touchpoint, lookup mapping needs to be processed for syncing 
the details of the tax. Lookup is implemented for the types Tax & Freight.

However, every Business Processes are unique and may require mapping of the lookups. Click here to know 
more about the Lookup Mapping.

**Note: After the mapping changes, `Reset Generate` and `Reset Publish` the Touchpoint. Also click on the 
`Update Lookup tables` and `Update Configuration` in the Agent**.

## Attribute Mapping/Transformation

The mapping provided below will enable the user to sync the business partners 
from WooCommerce to SAP Business One. To know more, see [Mapping & Transformation Techniques]().

1.	Mapping from the Complex Object Collection `Documents`.

Image

a.	Cardcode: Syncs the customer id for whom the order was created in WooCommerce.
b.	DocDate: Syncs the created date of the order document.
c.	DocDueDate: Syncs the created date of the order document.
d.	NumAtCard: Syncs the Business Partner id available for the order card.

Image

The above mapped fields are the custom fields whose UDF's needs to be formed in SAP Business One for syncing the data to the custom fields.

2.	Mapping for the ComplexObject `Document_Lines`
Image

a.	ItemCode: Sync the SKU of the product for which the order is created
b.	UnitPrice: Syncs the price of the product available in the order document
c.	Quantity: Transforms the quantity ordered
d.	TaxCode: Syncs the TaxCode to SAP Business One from WooCommerce
e.	DiscountPercent: Transforms the Discount Percentage if any to WooCommerce
f.	U_WebOrderItemId: Syncs the web id of item to WooCommerce

**Note: After the mapping changes, `Reset Generate` and `Reset Publish` the Touchpoint. Also click `Update Configuration` in the Agent for updating the changes in the On-Premise Agent.
These are the default mappings that needs to sync a sales order from WooCommerce to SAP Business One. 
User can also map different fields as per the user requirement.**

## Troubleshooting

1.	Property `U_ConnectionId` of `Document` is invalid.
Image

Solution: `U_ConnectionId` being a custom field, needs to have an UDF created for the value that could be stored. For troubleshooting this error, user needs to create an UDF in SAP Business One environment.
The UDF should be created in the mentioned pathway: MasterData >> Marketing Documents >> Title.

**Note: Once all the UDFs are created, users are suggested to restart the Di Server mandatorily and 
Resync the failed the data**

2. Item Number is missing; specify an item number

Image

Solution: User needs to verify the mapping for the ItemCode attribute under the  ComplexObject `Document_Lines`. If the mapping is correct, 
yet the error persists, verify the XPATH provided for the ComplexObject.
