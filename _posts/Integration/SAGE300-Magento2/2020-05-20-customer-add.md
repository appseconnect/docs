Executing the Process is a vital part when integrating any applications. This section of the document will let the users understand how the integration process can be executed through workflow for adding customers from Magento2 to SAGE  300.

## Brief Description:

![custadd1](\staticfiles\integration\Sage300-Magento\custadd1.png)

Here, the Touchpoint Customer is used for syncing multiples customers from [Magento2](/connectors/Magento2/) to [SAGE 300](/connectors/sage300/). A [Post-Task](/transformation/handling-dependent-data/) Address Add is also attached for syncing customer address to SAGE 300. A workflow is designed and executed with the Customer Add touchpoint where Customers are being added to SAGE 300 from Magento2. The customer is created in Magento 2 and is synced to the SAGE 300.

Login to Magento 2 Application and [add customers](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ce/user_guide/customers/account-create.html) in Magento2.

## Lookup Mapping 

For posting newly added customer to SAGE 300 from Magento, you need to add Lookup for Customer Group & Tax. For this integration of Customer, mapping lookups for the group code of Customer & Tax is mandatory.

**Note**: After mapping changes is done, `Reset Generate` and `Reset Publish` the Touchpoint from the workflow design panel. Refresh the Page and [Publish the workflow](/workflow/deploying-and-executing/#publishing-a-workflow). After Republishing, click on the Update Configuration followed by the Update Lookup Tables button in the Agent.

## Executing the Integration using Workflow:

1.	Once the workflow is designed, Update the Configuration in agent for deploying the workflow in the agent. [Click here](/workflow/deploying-and-executing/) to know more about the deploying process of a workflow.

2.	Navigate to the Workflow Panel in the agent and click on the **Start Sync Button** for executing the Process.

3. You can also trigger or deploy the workflow from the cloud Portal by clicking on the run button. For more details [Click Here](/workflow/steps-to-create-your-first-workflow/#steps-to-workflow-creation).

## Integration Data Survey:

You can survey the data by viewing the [Processed Snapshot](/workflow/list-of-snapshot/) from the node level of the workflow.


## Post Conditions:
You can view the data sync in SAGE 300 by viewing the `Accounts Receivable > A/R Customers.`


## Frequency of Use:

The user can execute the Integration through workflow as and when required. 

## Limitations:
NA

## Troubleshooting:

1.	**Remote Server returned an error: (409) Conflict.**

**Resolution:** You may have faced this error because of a lookup which has not been successfully transformed. Verify in the transform file whether the value of lookup mapped attribute is transformed or not. If not, you need to rectify your mapping, or you need to add new lookup table for this connection.

Following the above procedures, you can successfully sync customer from Magento 2 to SAGE 300.
