## APPSeCONNECT API Management  

APPSeCONNECT being an [API management platform](/api-management/architecture-design-runtime/) allows to create, manage, deploy, maintain APIs for an organization
such that the APIs can be easily tracked inside the organization. Let us look how to create or manage API management 
inside APPSeCONNECT platform. 


### Prerequisites

To create an API at the first place, there are a number of things you require,

- You need an Active APPSeCONNECT Account. Go to [Home Page](/getting%20started/user-registration/) for login details
- You need to know all the data sources that are used for the APIs. 
- You need to [create or configure APPS](/api-management/choosing-backend-apps/) on the platform.

Listed below are the areas you may require when working with [APPSeCONNECT API Management](/api-management/overview/).
