Webhooks are custom callbacks from an application which is generated by the caller and 
data is pushed to all of the subscribers.Webooks are based on Publisher-Subscriber model,
where the publisher will publish something and subscribers thats are only registered for
the publisher will listen to it. 

A Webhook is simply an event notification where the sender will send real time data 
typically via `HTTP POST` to other applications which have registered for that event. 
Data that are transferred are typically in `XML` or in `JSON` or in Form-Encoded format 
which is to be decided by the provider.

With **APPSeCONECT**, you can create webhook endpoint which are basically handlers for a 
WebHook that can be used to fetch real time data from an application that has support 
of webhook and that data can then be synced to other apps via APPSeCONNECT Integration 
Platform in real time using real-time API.

Follow these steps to create a Webhook API with **APPSeCONECT**

## Prerequisites

As per requirement, before you start creating a new API Proxy, you need to make sure you meet all the 
prerequisites. Here are some of them : 

1. [Getting a new account for APPSeCONNECT](/home/)
2. [Configuring your Environment](/deployment/Enviornment-Overview/)
3. [Choosing Apps or Adding Apps](/getting-started/#choosing-application)
4. [Importing schemas and actions of an Application](/getting-started/)
5. [Feeding Credentials for applications and data sources](/connectors/OLEDB-Credentials/)
5. [Creating a Connection](/getting-started/#creating-connection--executing-the-touchpoint)
7. [Registering URL for API](/api-management/Steps-to-register-url/)
8. [User Authenticate](/api-management/Steps-to-user-authentication/)

After all these steps are done, make sure the environment is kept running and credentials are properly updated. 

**Note: Registering an URL is must when syncing data through Realtime Touchpoints (Webhook APIs). Real-Time touchpoints would be 
executed only for the applications that supports Webhooks.**

Few known examples of  applications that supports Webhooks are:
* Shopify
* 3DCart
* WooCommerce
* Zoho CRM 
* BigCommerce
* Salesforce
* Prestashop

Before, integrating with Realtime Webhooks, user needs to know whether the used application supports Webhooks.

## Steps to Create Webhook Endpoint- Real Time API

For creating a Webhook Realtime API, login to APPSeCONNECT portal and follow the steps given below:

* Navigate to API section of the APPSeCONNECT Portal available on the left side menu. Inside **APIManagementSection** you can see Webhooks 
  and Proxy.`By default Webhook section will be shown`. You can see all your connections listed here.

**Note:If you do not have a registered URL with **APPSeCONNECT** you have to [Register a URL](/api-management/Steps-to-register-url/) for 
your organization.**

1. Now under the desired connection,Expand the Connection,you will find **Add New API** button like this.
![CreateAPI_webhook](/staticfiles/api-management/media/CreateAPI_webhook.png)
2. Upon clicking the button you will get introduced to a Wizard like this. Provide basic information like API name, 
   API help document URL etc.
![Wizard-API-Basic](/staticfiles/api-management/media/Wizard-API-Basic.png)

**Note:It is mandatory for the user to enable the checkbox for `Show in Agent`, else user cannot view the touchpoint and run the sync process.**
4. Now provide Source App Configuration like Source Schema,Action,Protocol and Protocol Method.
![Wizard-API-Source](/staticfiles/api-management/media/Wizard-API-Source.png)
5. Thereafter provide Destination App Configuration like Destination Schema,Action,Protocol and Protocol Method.
![Wizard-API-Destination](/staticfiles/api-management/media/Wizard-API-Destination.png)
6. Then you have to configure mapping for transformation from source to destination

7. After everything is done click on finish to Save your API.
![Wizard-API-Summary](/staticfiles/api-management/media/Wizard-API-Summary.png)
8. You will be re-directed to Webhook section afterwards.You can find your newly created Webhook API
 under the connection you created.
![Webhook-API-Data](/staticfiles/api-management/media/Webhook-API-Data.png)  
9.	The Touchpoint will consist of two buttons:  
* Bucket: This is the Resync bucket of the touchpoint. Any Data synced (Data that are Success, Failed, Unprocessed & Skipped) 
  in OP will automatically reflect in the Resync Bucket of the Portal.
* Log: This the Log Bucket of the Touch point and will display the logs, processed during the sync process.
![webhook-resyncbucket](/staticfiles/api-management/media/webhook-resyncbucket.png) 

9. Copy the URL and use it as a webhook endpoint in applications that support webhooks.
![API-Webhook-shopify](/staticfiles/api-management/media/API-Webhook-shopify.png) 

Thus APPSeConnect provides you the platform to create Webhook API to fetch real time data and sync to other applications.    

**Note: Realtime Webhook APIs does not require any Actions & Action Filters for the sync process.**
