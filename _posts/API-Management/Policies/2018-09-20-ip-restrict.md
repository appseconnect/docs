---
The **IP Restrict Policy** is used to restrict the access of an API Proxy by limiting the number of IP Addresses who can access it.If an organization wants to develop an API which is to be accessed from only a set of IP addresses,and wants to block 
the access for all other clients,this policy would provide exactly that configuration and thus controls the access for a particular API Proxy.

**ProTip:** Policy can only be used once per API configuration.

### Policy Statement

Each policy requires certain configuration, which will allow to configure the policy for a particular API endpoint. 
Below are the list of configurations required for this policy.
