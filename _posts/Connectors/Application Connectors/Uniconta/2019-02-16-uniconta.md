## Troubleshooting

ISSUE 1:
Some of the basic troubleshooting issue happens due to improper validations or even if it is accurately validated and if touchpoints do not sync, this basic issue resolves after removing the Temp and Cache files 
from the portal and from your system. Therefore, after clearing all this publish the touchpoints again along with Update Configuration on the agent.

For E.g. If the `Source Application Not Found` in the log file appears, the probable cause is due to the presence of the Temp and Cache Files.

endpoint while schema is the data needed to execute the API. Here, is the list of some of the pre-packaged API actions defined 
for you which you can easily plug and play while doing your integrations.
