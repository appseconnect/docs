Application configuration is an integral activity prior to the process of integration. If your chosen application is Priority, such as generating the Company URL for Priority,

Here you will find the detailed description on how to configure the agents for the application of Shopify, attributes and action, and the Troubleshooting issues.


## Pre-requisites for Priority Configuration:

1. Must have a valid Priority Account.
2. Login to AEC Agents with the valid credentials.To Know about Agent Configuration, [Click here](/deployment/Deployment-Configuration/)
3. Add a connection Template for Priority and publish a touchpoint.

Follow the above steps, the adapter for Priority can be configured in the APPSeCONNECT agent.

## Integration Techniques

For Integration process, you need to execute the necessary touchpoint in your connection as required while syncing.

1.	For an Instance: Suppose you need to add Product created in Priority to the application you need. 
    Therefore, the Product Add Touchpoint is needed to publish, for syncing the customer from Priority 
    to the other Application you are working with.

## Troubleshooting

While adding product from priority to shopify, ensure that `Show in web` is marked `Yes` or the option `Purchased Via Website` is enabled. 

Suppose you are updating inventory for 20 products but have not marked, show in web for those products, hence after integration your inventory will
not get updated. It will only get updated when `Show in Web` is marked as "YES".

## Attributes and Actions

While defining a connect to a particular API endpoint inPriority, you require clear understanding about the data requirements 
and endpoint configurations. You can refer to this document to find all the endpoint details of your Priority installation. 
To define the endpoint in APPSeCONNECT, you need to define Actions and Entities. Actions are specifically targeted for a particular 
endpoint while schema is the data needed to execute the API. Here is the list of some of the prepackaged API actions defined for you 
which you can easily plug and play while doing your integration.
