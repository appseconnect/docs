# You received error : Property 'Attribute' of 'Entity' is invalid

# Symptom

During your sync operation, you receive an invalid property on an entity. The 'XXX' attribute of your Transformed file is 
invalid on target application, which is SAP B1. 

# Cause

There might be a number of reasons for this error: 

- The propery is mistakenly created during transformation, and you don't need it to be present in Target application. 
- The property is created from pre-packaged template, and you don't know what to do with it. 
- The property is required to be synched to target application as an User Defined field.
