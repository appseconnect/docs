Application configuration is an integral activity prior to the process of integration. If your chosen application is SAGE 300, credentials need to be provided for validating the agent.
Here you will find the detailed description on how to configure the agents for the application of SAGE300, Troubleshooting issues and the attributes and action.

# Pre-requisites for Sage300  Configuration 

1.	Select the application SAGE 300 in the [APPS](/getting%20started/configurations/#process-of-choosing-app) section of the APPSeCONNECT Portal.
2.	Create and publish a [connection](/getting%20started/configurations-for-integration/#configuring-connector-while-creating-connection) in the cloud portal.
3.	Login to the Agent & Update the Configuration in your On-Premise AEC Agent. You will find your Connection present in the agent.
    To Know about Agent Configuration, [Click here](/deployment/Deployment-Configuration/)

**Note: If you are working with custom connector (per business need), custom touchpoints are needed to be created**

## Configure the Sage300 Application in the Agent

 1. Login to the APPSeCONNECT Agent.
 2. Click on Apps Configurations button in the agent. Choose the APPS.

**Note: If AEC Agent is not opening after placing the adapter in AEC -> Adapter folder, 
please unblock the .dll and .pdb file from properties section**

## Troubleshooting

ISSUE 1:
Some of the basic troubleshooting issue happens even after accurate validation done and the touchpoints do not sync. 

"If touchpoints do not sync", we need to do republish touchpoint and reset cache from portal.appseconnect.com and after that do update 
configuration from APPSeCONNECT agent.

**Note: For Integrating SAGE 300 with WooCommerce, `The APPSeCONNECT Extension` is needed to be `uploaded in WooCommerce`.**

The steps for adding plugins/extensions into WooCommerce is [provided here](/connectors/woocommerce-plugin-extension-upload/)

## Attributes and Actions

While defining a connect to an API endpoint in SAGE300, you require clear understanding about the data requirements 
and endpoint configurations. You can refer to this document to find all the endpoint details of your SAGE300 installation.
To define the endpoint in APPSeCONNECT you need Actions and Entities. Actions are specifically targeted for an endpoint
while schema is the data needed to execute the API. Here, is the list of some of the pre-packaged API actions defined 
for you which you can easily plug and play while doing your integrations.

The API Documentation for SAGE300 can be accessed from the SWAGGER Documentation. For accessing the same, 
Navigate to the "protocol://servername/Sage300WebApi", where the Protocol is HTTP or HTTPS and the ServerName is the name of the SAGE300 server.
For Eg: https://localhost/Sage300WebApi
