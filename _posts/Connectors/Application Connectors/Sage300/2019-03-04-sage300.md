Application configuration is an integral activity prior to the process of integration. If your chosen application is SAGE 300, credentials need to be provided for validating the agent.
Here you will find the detailed description on how to configure the agents for the application of SAGE300, Troubleshooting issues and the attributes and action.

# Pre-requisites for Sage300  Configuration 

1.	Select the application SAGE 300 in the APPS section of the APPSeCONNECT Portal.
2.	Create and publish a connection in the cloud portal.
3.	Login to the Agent & Update the Configuration in your On-Premise AEC Agent. You will find your Connection present in the agent.
    To Know about Agent Configuration, [Click here](/deployment/Deployment-Configuration/)

**Note: If you are working with custom connector (per business need), custom touchpoints are needed to be created**

## Configure the Sage300 Application in the Agent

 1. Login to the APPSeCONNECT Agent.
 2. Click on Apps Configurations button in the agent. Choose the APPS.

**Note: If you have any Tenant ID put it into the specified field, otherwise giving Hyphen (-)is mandatory**

You can get the Database ID of your organization from More > Common Services > Company Profile

**Note: If AEC Agent is not opening after placing the adapter in AEC -> Adapter folder, 
please unblock the .dll and .pdb file from properties section**

## Troubleshooting

ISSUE 1:
Some of the basic troubleshooting issue happens due to improper validations or even if it is accurately validated and if touchpoints do not sync. 
This basic issue resolves after removing the Temp and Cache files from the portal and from your system. Therefore, after clearing all this 
publish the touchpoints again along with Update Configuration on the agent.

For E.g. If the Source Application Not Found in the log file appears the probable cause is due to the presence of the Temp and Cache Files.

**Note: For Integrating SAGE 300 with WooCommerce, `The APPSeCONNECT Extension` is needed to be `uploaded in WooCommerce`.**

The steps for adding plugins/extensions into WooCommerce is [provided here](/connectors/woocommerce-plugin-extension-upload/)

## Attributes and Actions

While defining a connect to an API endpoint in SAGE300, you require clear understanding about the data requirements 
and endpoint configurations. You can refer to this document to find all the endpoint details of your SAGE300 installation.
To define the endpoint in APPSeCONNECT you need Actions and Entities. Actions are specifically targeted for an endpoint
while schema is the data needed to execute the API. Here, is the list of some of the pre-packaged API actions defined 
for you which you can easily plug and play while doing your integrations.
