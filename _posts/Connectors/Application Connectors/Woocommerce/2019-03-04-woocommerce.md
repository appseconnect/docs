Application configuration is an integral activity prior to the process of integration. If your chosen application is WooCommerce, 
credentials need to be provided for validating the agent. Here you will find the detailed description on 
how to configure the agents for the application of WooCommerce, Troubleshooting issues and the attributes and action.

WooCommerce is a REST Application which supports both the BASIC & OAuth 1.0 authentication. The Adapter of the application WooCommerce
provides the leverage to communicate and adapt with the AEC Portal. This section provides you the detailed process of validating
the credential of the application WooCommerce.

# Pre-requisites for WooCommerce Configuration 

1.	Valid APPSeCONNECT Portal credentials.
2.	Select the Application WooCommerce in the APP section.
3.	Create a connection for WooCommerce.
4.	Publish a Touchpoint Update Adapters and Update Configuration in the agent.

**Note: Touchpoints are needed to be created if there are no pre-packaged touchpoints.**

## Configuring the WooCommerce Adapter

1.	In the App Configuration panel of the agent, click on the + button, beside the app WooCommerce

2.  On clicking the + button, the credential panel opens for the application WooCommerce.

3.  The Base URL Endpoint has 2 options in the drop-down.  
a.	/wp-json/wc/ - This is the newer version of the WooCommerce that support the    WordPress platform for WooCommerce. 
The version for this WooCommerce version should be >=2.6  
b.	/wc-api/ - This endpoint is for the older version of the WooCommerce platform. If the user platform is based on the older version, this end point is needed to be selected for agent validation.
The version for this WooCommerce version should be <2.6   
4. The API Version is the WooCommerce API Version. The user can have its WC Version by navigating to WooCommerce > Status > WooCommerce Version.

**Note: For more details about WC API versions, [click here](https://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-rest-api-docs/?javascript#introduction)**
5.	The check-box fields are the HTTP Headers that needs to be enabled if the http headers are required.

6.  The Base URL is the WooCommerce Base URL. For Ex:http://templatebar.com/Individual/abcd/woocommerce  
**Note: If the URL has HTTP, the authentication OAuth 1.0 is supported and if the URL has HTTPS, the BASIC Authentication is supported. 
For both authentication process, the User Interface remains the same.**
7.	The API Key and the API Secret is generated from the WooCommerce platform. Navigate to WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced > REST API > ADD Key 
![woocommerce-adapter5](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/woocommerce-adapter5.png)
8.	Provide the details in the field provided in the WC platform and click on the Generate API Key Button.
a.	Description: This is the field for API Description.
b.	User: This field is for specifying the User Type. The user should be as ADMIN 
c.	Permissions: This is a drop-down field; the permission should be selected as Read/Write for providing the permission for GET and CREATE operations.
![woocommerce-adapter6](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/woocommerce-adapter6.png)
9.	Input the generated API Key and the API Secret in the Agent.
![woocommerce-adapter7](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/woocommerce-adapter7.png)
**Note: The Consumer Key is the API Key and the Consumer Secret is the API Secret.**
10.	Input the WooCommerce Username and Password in the Agent and click on the Validate and SAVE button.

Following these steps, ends the process for validating agent for the application WooCommerce. 

## Troubleshooting

**ISSUE 1:  If the Source Application Not Found**
Some of the basic troubleshooting issue happens due to improper validations or even if it is accurately validated, and if touchpoints do not sync, this basic issue
resolves after removing the Temp and Cache files from the portal and from your system. Therefore, after clearing all this publish the touchpoints again along with Update Configuration on the agent.
For E.g. If the Source Application Not Found in the log file appears, the probable cause is due to the presence of the Temp and Cache Files.


**ISSUE 2: Plugin Installation Issue**

On Syncing Customer Add touchpoint from WooCommerce to any destination application, it is noted that only 
First 10 customers created, successfully synced, but it fails or shows no result in the resync bucket 
when the 11th customer is synced.

This is due to the plugin that might not have been installed. The process of uploading the plugin is provided 
in the prerequisite section of this page.

**Note: It is the feature in WooCommerce that without the AEC plugin, more than 10 customers will not sync**

## Attributes and Actions

While defining a connect to an API endpoint in WooCommerce, you require clear understanding about the data requirements 
and endpoint configurations. You can refer to this document to find all the endpoint details of your WooCommerce installation.
 
To define the endpoint in APPSeCONNECT, you need Actions and Entities. Actions are specifically targeted for an endpoint 
while schema is the data needed to execute the API. Here, is the list of some of the pre-packaged API actions defined 
for you which you can easily plug and play while doing your integrations.
