An Application connectors are Pre-built optimized solution developed by APPSeCONNECT backend developer team and tested 
in real-life scenarios. If you have an application which has an application connector present on APPSeCONNECT platform,
you as an end user require very small effort to configure the connector to work correctly with the application. These connectors are 
maintained by the InSync team which consists of a number of highly skilled developers who work with the platform
to provide Actions and Schemas specific to the Application.

For application connectors, we have pre-built templates as well which connects two or more application together
where all the business logic to transform data from one application to another is pre-baked and devleoped and tested. 
Hence as an user, you can readily use those connectors just by adding them to your project and execute them on the platform.
Sometimes, these connectors requires some trivial adjustments because may be your applications are highly customized, and these 
adjustments can be implemented easily in the portal with zero code requirements.
