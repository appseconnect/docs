Generic REST Adapter is a software which provides REST applications a leverage to communicate and adapt with the 
AEC Portal. This adapter is App-specific and is limited to certain apps which are developed using HTTP Protocol 
and REST Webservices. 

The REST Adapter can expose integrations as REST APIs by configuring a REST Adapter connection as a trigger. 
The REST Adapter can also consume any external REST API by configuring a REST Adapter connection as an invoke. 
This section identifies the capabilities of the REST Adapter when used as a trigger or invoke connection.
