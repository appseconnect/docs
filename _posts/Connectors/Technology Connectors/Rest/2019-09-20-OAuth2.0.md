## Process to Configure OAuth2.0 in Generic Rest Adapter - On Premise

To configure the OAuth2.0 Authentication type for Generic Rest Adapter follow the steps given below:

1. [Login to APPSeCONNECT Portal](https://docs.appseconnect.com/)
2. [Create Technology Application](/getting-started/#creating-connection--executing-the-touchpoint) using generic rest adapter. Choose `REST` option while creating technology application for REST based protocol.  

**Protip:** You can use either both technology app or one tech app and one prepackaged app while creating a connection. 
 Also you need to click `Configure Connector` button for creating connection as your desired connection is made of custom application.   
 {: .notice--info}      
  
**Protip:** Here you will get a connection for lightspeed (which supports OAUTH 2.0 for authentication) where you can view the validation
details as required     
{: .notice--info}     

Once the connection is created, Login to the agent.      
Go to the App Configuration page on your OP Agent, and Click on Update Configuration.  
You can now view the chosen applications in your agent. Here **LIGHTSPEED is OAUTH 2.0 supported Application**,

![Rest-Outh2.0Authentation-Screen3](/staticfiles/connectors/media/technology-connector/Rest-Outh2.0Authentation-Screen3.png)       

Provide the Authentication Credential and the Base URL.  

The Authentication fields for OAUTH 2.0 are:   
* Client ID – This is generated when the client logs into the Application.
* Client Secret - This field is also generated by the REST supported Application.
* Call Back URL - This is the secondary URL required for data restoration. 
* Authentication URL – This URL is generated along with the Client ID and Client Secret in the REST application itself.
* Access Token URL 
* Scope (Optional) 
* Access Type (optional) 
* Grant – Authorization Code  
        
**Protip:** By default, SCOPE is an optional field in AEC Agent, but for some applications providing scope is mandatory, 
you need to provide the SCOPE for those applications 
{: .notice--info}   
      
Here, we need to generate token which can be done by clicking `VALIDATE` button. 

![Rest-Outh2.0Authentation-Screen4](/staticfiles/connectors/media/technology-connector/Rest-Outh2.0Authentation-Screen4.png)  
 
- On clicking the Validate button, it will redirect you to the Application Specific Page where you need to login 
with the credential that you have provided during the Account Creation.  
- Once, you have logged in, click on the Mail Service Provider. This will redirect you to blank page.
- Make sure that you do not close the blank page. Once done, click on Generate Token on your OP agent.  
- Select the Content-Type as JSON. Click on Validate and SAVE.    


**Protip:**  Similarly, for the other Authorization Type for REST APPLICATION as well, we have similar process of integration

## Process to Configure OAuth2.0 in Generic Rest Adapter - Cloud

Follow the steps given below to configure Oauth 2.0 in Generic Rest Adapter in Cloud Enviornment.

1. [Login to APPSeCONNECT Portal](https://docs.appseconnect.com/)   
2. [Create Technology Application](/getting-started/#b-technology-app-creation) using generic rest adapter. Choose `REST` option while creating technology application for REST based protocol.  

    
**Protip:** You can use either both technology app or one tech app and one prepackaged app while creating a connection. 
 Also you need to click `Configure Connector` button for creating connection as your desired connection is made of custom application.   
 {: .notice--info}  
      
 Go to the `App section` of the portal  and you can view the selected application as shown below.
![Rest-OAuth2-CloudCredential](/staticfiles/connectors/media/technology-connector/Rest-OAuth2-CloudCredential.png)      
 Click Credential button for the choosen application and the following screen appears
![Rest-OAuth2-CloudCredential2](/staticfiles/connectors/media/technology-connector/Rest-OAuth2-CloudCredential2.png)    
![Rest-OAuth2-CloudCredential3](/staticfiles/connectors/media/technology-connector/Rest-OAuth2-CloudCredential3.png)      
Here you need to enter the following details as shown:  
* Credential Name: Enter the Credential Name.
* URL: This is the base URL, input the URL 
* Key & Value: This is the content type section that includes the file format types like XML, JSON.
  Input the value from the drop down list of content type field.
* Authorization: Select OAuth 2.0 from the drop down list.
* Client Id: This is generated when the client logs into the Application. Input the Client Id.
* Auth URL: This URL is generated along with the Client ID and Client Secret in the REST application itself. Input the Auth URL
* Callback URL: This is the secondary URL required for data restoration. This url will be `https://portal.appseconnect.com/Dashboard` . 

**NOTE: Use this url in the callback/redirect url field while generating client id and 
client secret for the new app**

* Access Token URL: An Access Token is a credential that can be used by an application to access an API. They inform the API that the 
  bearer of the token has been authorized to access the API and perform specific actions specified by the scope that has been granted.
* Client Secret: This field is also generated by the REST supported Application.
* Scope (Optional)
* Grant Type: This is the Authorization Code 
* Access Type (optional)   


Click Grant button, to authorize the application. 

You will get success message for Oauth2.0 saying **Tokens Generated** when both `Access and Refresh Tokens` are generated.  

Now this will take you to the login page of the application. 

Provide the login credentials. This will thereby allow you to access the application with a pop up message as shown below  
![Oauth2-Rest-access_authorization](/staticfiles/connectors/media/technology-connector/Oauth2-Rest-access_authorization.png) 
     
Click Save button, to Save the Credential.

If the Authorization fails, you will get a failure message saying **Failed to create tokens**  

**Protip:**  In Rest Based Integration for Cloud Connection Use Portal URL as Call back URL
