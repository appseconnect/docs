## Operations

### For GET Operation

The GET Operation is for fetching data from REST. Use GET requests to retrieve resource information only â€“ and not to modify 
it in any way. 

As GET requests do not change the state of the resource, these are said to be safe methods. Additionally, GET APIs should fetch 
multiple identical requests and produce the same result every time until another API (POST or PUT) 
has changed the state of the resource on the server.
