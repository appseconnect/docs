Connectors are part of the communication bridge that connects different data sources both on-premise 
or in cloud (exposed to WWW) using standard protocol for communication. APPSeCONNECT comes with a number of 
technology connectors which can connect any data source having standard protocol based communication channel 
established. The connectors are plug and play oriented and hence within APPSeCONNECT one can 
easily add a technology connector and connect an App using popular technology. 

APPSeCONNECT allows custom development of connectors. As these technology connectors are more inclined towards
own custom made applications or custom data sources, the connection need to be implemented correctly 
within the application such that data can freely flow from the data source to the other end of the application.
