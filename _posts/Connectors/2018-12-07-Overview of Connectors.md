AEC Connectors acts like a bridge to create connection between applications that connects different data sources both on-premise 
or in cloud (exposed to WWW) using standard protocol for communication. APPSeCONNECT comes with a number of 
connectors types which can connect any data source having standard protocol based communication channel 
established. The connectors are plug and play oriented and hence within APPSeCONNECT one can 
easily add a technology connector and connect an App using popular technology.
