## Design

We added more features for the users in  this release which includes `Self loop, Splitter Node, Merger Node, Decision Node, 
Unassign Lookup, Auto Retry` and many more. These features are useful and helps 
you to plug and play with data during an integration using process flow.     

#### New Features 
 
**Self-loop to Iterate a Node**  

You now have the flexibility to use self-loop in a node to iterate as per configuration and two options are available for that 
* Until data available - To iterate a node and continue to execute until data is available from source node/source application.
* Number of occurrences - To choose number of iterations, a node will execute. You can set the maximum limit of 999 for [self-loop](/processflow/working-with-processflow-selfloop/) execution. 

**Splitter Node for PayLoad**

You can use splitter node in process flow 
* To [Split](/processflow/working-with-processflow-splitter/) large volume of data.
* To process and validate each data individually.
* To reduce the load to successive node.

**Merger Node for Managing Multiple Records**  
 You can now manage collection of records in order   
* To [Merge](/processflow/working-with-processflow-merger/) multiple records.  
* To reduce number of hits into successive nodes.  

**Decision Node for Controlled Execution** 

You can now use [decision](/processflow/working-with-decision/) node in Process flow   
* To carry out an execution based on the condition tables.
* To control execution path based on IF-ELSE criteria. 
* To evaluate the condition using Static Value /Generic Functions/ Attribute.

#### Enhancements

**Workflow Snapshot**   
Fix:      
      For Workflow (Hosted Agent) Snapshot generation is happening for huge data sync, however the POST node was blank.    
      
With this release, users can view the [workflow](/workflow/overview/) POST node with accurate data of execution for both success and failed data.    

**Workflow Self Loop Iteration**

Fix:   
      Workflow with Self Loop allowed only '2' in the corresponding field to execute the self-loop  
      
With this release, users can execute a workflow, enabling Self loop with values ranging from `1 to 99`. 
Therefore, you can run the self-loop multiple times per your business requirements.
