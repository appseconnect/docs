Designer 

#### Designer

In the designer area of Process flow, we have come up with the following features

**(a) Self-loop for Iterating in Loop Variable**  

You now have the flexibility to use loop in a node to iterate as per configuration. Presently you will get two options to configure self-loop. 
* Until data available - To iterate over a node and continue to execute until data is available in that node.
* Number of occurrences - To choose number of iterations on node over for self-loop execution.  The maximum limit you can set for the iteration is 999.

**(b) Splitter Node for Load Balancing in Nodes**

You can now manage huge volume of data in process flow with the availability of Splitter node
* To Split large volume of data.
* To process and validate each data individually.
* To reduce the load to successive node.

**(c) Merger Node for Managing Multiple Records**  
 You can now manage collection of records in order   
�	To Merge multiple records.  
�	To reduce number of hits into successive nodes.  

**(d) Decision Node for Controlled Execution** 

You can now use decision node in Process flow   
* To carry out an execution based on the condition tables.
* To control execution path based on IF-ELSE criteria. 
* To evaluate the condition using Static Value /Generic Functions/ Attribute.

#### Deploy

**(a) Lookup Repository Deployment**

You can now manage and create Lookup types in form of tables for the organisation.

* To unfix & unassign the lookup warnings in the Deployment Wizard for quick implementation of changes with respect to execution
* To deploy Reference tables such that the lookup mapping used for the attributes syncs correct data to destination application

**(b) Support for Auto Retry for Failed Transaction**

* To share and reuse the custom Appresource function, you get the flexibility to create it in app level. 
* To restrict reusing of the custom Appresource function, you can define within the specific mapper node.


**Workflow Snapshot**   
Fix Given:      
      For Workflow (Cloud Agent Execution) Snapshot generation is happening for huge data sync, however the POST node was blank.    
      
With this release, users can view the workflow POST node with accurate data of execution for both success and failed data.    

**Workflow Self Loop Iteration**

Fix Given:   
      Workflow with Self Loop allowed only '2' in the corresponding field to execute the self-loop  
      
With this release, users can execute a workflow, enabling Self loop with values ranging from `1 to 99`. 
Therefore, you can run the self-loop multiple times per your business requirements.
