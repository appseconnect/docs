## Hotfix Release Details 

We have introduced our APPSeCONNECT 2021-22 Q1 release which features an extensive update to its features. This Hotfix Release (Q1 2021 V1) Note lists you with the issues and resolutions of the updates made in last release and also gives you some insights on some of the production bugs that we have addressed too.

### Design 

- **Improvement** - We have felt that the previous action filter screen was not giving us best user experience and hence in this release, we have revamped the action filter page inside ProcessFlow to a new and improved UI. Refer [to the link](/processflow/manage-actions-actionfilters-errorfilters/#adding-action-filters). 

- **Issue - Variable Edit is not getting reflected inside transformation**
**Resolution** - The variable edits should automatically refresh the transformation. We have identified it and fixed it in this release. 

### Deploy  

- **Improvements** - The new snapshots generated through the platform will now produce an indicator to identify whether the snapshot is generated for Resync / Runtime execution / automatic scheduled or triggered. This will allow you identify and pick proper snapshot to look at. Refer [to this link](/processflow/snapshot-processflow/#types-of-snapshot)
- **Improvements** - We have felt that there was no link between our Sync Info and Snapshots, this was a problem which we wanted to address. We have introduced a button which will filter out all the snapshots related to a perticular sync info. This will give you an history of snapshots created to address a perticular sync data. [Refer to this link](/processflow/retry-processflow/#sync-info--retry)

### Manage  

- **Improvements** - We have added audit entries for Runtime filters and deployment section of ProcessFlow.

### Other Area

- **Improvements** - We have introduced the new chat functionality in our portal which will ensure better customer engagement. The chat window will be available on the bottom right corner of the screen and is much improved than our last option. Refer [to this link](/accessing%20portal/accessing-portal/#chat).
