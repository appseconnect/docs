## Hotfix Release Details 

We have introduced our APPSeCONNECT 2021-22 Q1 release which features an extensive update to its features. This Hotfix Release Note lists you with the issues and resolutions of the updates.

### Design 

- **Improvements** - We have felt that the previous action filter screen was not giving us best user experience and hence in this release, we have revamped the [action filter](/processflow/manage-actions-actionfilters-errorfilters/#adding-action-filters) page inside ProcessFlow to a new and improved UI.

- **Issue** - Root variable defined as Root Loop can be made twice.
- **Resolution** - Generally it is not recommended to create two variables with Root Loop as there will be nested for loop inside the transformation. We have identified it as a flaw and we have put it as validation such that you as an user cannot create more than one variable as Root loop inside the same scope.

- **Issue** - Variable Edit is not getting reflected inside transformation
- **Resolution** - The variable edits should automatically refresh the transformation. We have identified it and fixed it in this release. 

- **Issue** - Source Tree in mapping is taking huge time to load.
- **Resolution** - We have enhanced the section to ensure the time it takes to load the tree could be minimised. 

- **Issue** - Execute button is getting enabled for Triggered Processflow
- **Resolution** - The manual execution should not be allowed for Triggered Processflow. We have identified it and have put a restriction to ensure the execute cannot be clicked whenever a triggered processflow is deployed.

### Deploy  

- **Improvements** - The new snapshots generated through the platform will now produce an indicator to identify whether the snapshot is generated for Resync / Runtime execution / automatic scheduled or triggered. This will allow you identify and pick proper snapshot to look at. 
- **Improvements** - We have felt that there was no link between our Sync Info and Snapshots, this was a problem which we wanted to address. We have introduced a button which will filter out all the snapshots related to a perticular sync info. This will give you an [history of snapshots](/processflow/retry-processflow/#sync-info--retry) created to address a perticular sync data. 

- **Issue** - If an environment which is cloud agent is detached from the list, the deployed processflows are still getting executed.
- **Resolution** - We have taken this as a bug and when an environement is detached, all the processes deployed into it will be automatically undeployed.

- **Issue** - Schedule changes in OP agent is not updating the Cloud interfaces
- **Resolution** - The issue is resolved in this release, which will update the schedule changed on the agent is reflected in the cloud portal.

### Manage  

- **Improvements** - We have added audit entries for Runtime filters and deployment section of ProcessFlow.  

### Other Area

- **Feature** - As per requested, we have added a new rule which will give you various insights about your agents running on your premise. This rule will accumulate all the generated problems and give you a summary of the problems. 
- **Improvements** - We have introduced the new chat functionality in our portal which will ensure better customer engagement. The chat window will be available on the bottom right corner of the screen and is much improved than our last option.
