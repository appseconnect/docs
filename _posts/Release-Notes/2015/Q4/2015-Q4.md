Product Release Version: 3.3.0   
Release notes were published and last revised on January 2017 
APPSeCONNECT focusses on delivering more and more flexibility, power and ease to its 
users. We try to make our product more and more powerful and easier to use. 

We are one of the best integration platform in the market which delivers ready-made 
end to end business integration. We have improved the way our external developers, 
integration partners or even end customer work in the platform. 
With the latest enhancements, we have changed our platform way ahead providing our 
implementers a way to visualize the entire business at a go. We are really happy to 
announce some of the latest enhancements that we have made in this release. 

The platform is totally revamped with new look and feel with more enhanced look 
and feel, enhanced color schemes etc.

## Whats new for Administration
If you are an ISV or implementation partner, this release has a lot of things to offer for you.

* We have introduced Workflows, a new way of defining your business process. Workflow provides graphical view of your entire business and you can tweak / customize it very easily.
* Workflow now supports loops and powerful tooling to orchestrate the data flow from one application to another.
* You can split or merge data depending on the requirements of the application and to harness the power of integration.
* Chaining is yet supported, we are also free to separately create both parallel or sequential dependencies through workflows.
* New workflow can also engage touchpoints of different connections and hence enhances the reusability of the data and minimizing network usage.
* Workflow can be scheduled or even can be manually executed in agent and the same can be directly configured from our cloud portal as well.

In spite of several changes made to workflows, we have also included some of the unique functionalities on our admin portal which will help you to easily implement projects. Some of them includes:

* Enhanced Organization dashboard.
* Option to add application and / or connection from admin.
* Option to change connection details, protocols etc.
* Defining workflow from dashboard.
* Enhanced Value mapping screens for admin.
* New action page with enhanced user experience.

## What’s new in Agent 

* To enhance the way our Agent talks to the applications, we made subtle changes to the tool such that it can execute huge volume of data in a loop.
* We have separated the activity execution for each touchpoint, such that they can execute in parallel, and hence deliver better throughput.
* We are constantly improving the way agent executes workflows. Initially, we have been executing individual touchpoints, then we introduced dependencies and now we come with Workflows. As an integration developer, you are now flexible to define your own workflow without any restriction and our agent tool can handle it properly.

## What’s new in Cloud

* In APPSeCONNECT Cloud platform, we enhanced the look and feel with enhanced dashboard and other layout changes.
* As per requested by most of the user, we now support multiple versions of same application. That means, you can now, for instance, configure both Magento 1.x series and Magento 2 series in the same organization.
