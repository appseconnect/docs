I"ó<p>Throttling policy prevents an API usage spikes on per API version basis, such that if the same API is 
getting somehow spammed, the policy will automatically detect it and update the response accordingly. The 
API rate limit can be set up by the developer for a specified time period and when the policy is
triggered for a specific call, the caller will receive <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">429 - Throttling Maximum sending rate exceeded</code> as response status code.</p>
