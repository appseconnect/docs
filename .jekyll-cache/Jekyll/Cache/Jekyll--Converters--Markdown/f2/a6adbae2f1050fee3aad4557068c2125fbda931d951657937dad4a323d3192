<p>Workflow showing task configuration with  splitter rule</p>

<h3 id="brief-description">Brief Description</h3>

<p>This workflow enables the user to add business partner (in Magento 2) and enable the execution and data sync between Magento 2 &amp; SAP B1 with <a href="/workflow/working-with-splitter/">Splitter</a> node. 
The business partner touchpoint is used to fetch multiple customers, SPLITTER is used after GET Node and Merger is used after PROCESS.</p>

<p>In this case the multiple customer would be fetched and will be split. A self-loop is implemented on PROCESS node which will be executed as per the number of datas present. MERGER will merge all the data in a batch of 2 and will post the data.</p>

<p>For Example: 20 Business Partner will be merged into a batch of 2 which means it will be merged into 10 Packets. 
Similarly if there are 4 data(s) they will be merged in to 2 and will be generating 2 Packets each.</p>

<p>This workflow allows task configuration with data splitting.</p>
