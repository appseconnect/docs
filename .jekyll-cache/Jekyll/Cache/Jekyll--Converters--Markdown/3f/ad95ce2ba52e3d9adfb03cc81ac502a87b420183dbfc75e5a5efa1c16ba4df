I"*<p>Policies are special modules which hooks over an Http pipeline of API execution. In addition to prebuilt policies,
APPSeCONNECT also allows the developer to develop custom policies which will be applied through the API process 
execution. A custom made policy provides a Data repository, which needs a designer on the Portal itself to build the 
data design, and when the policy is applied with proper data dynamically provided while API creation, 
the policy can inspect the incoming Http Request and Response and provide certain action over it.</p>
