<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As per the latest versioning of Shopify API, for validating the Base URL for your Shopify store in APPSeCONNECT Agent, 
user/implementers need to add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">admin/api/2019-10/</code> as the suffix to the URL .</li>
  <li>This update is available from the On-Premise Agent version 4.4.10.0 &amp; above</li>
  <li>The adapter version for the Shopify adapter should be 4.2.2.2</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="integration-techniques">Integration Techniques</h2>

<p>For Integration process, you need to execute the necessary touchpoint in your connection as required while syncing.</p>

<p>1) For an Instance: Suppose you need to add customer created in shopify to the application you need. Therefore, the Customer Add Touchpoint is 
   needed to published, for syncing the customer from Shopify to the other Application you are working with.</p>

<p>2) Integration of Shopify - SAP B1 requires some UDT, UDO &amp; UDFâ€™s to be defined.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>ISSUE 1:</p>

<p>Some of the basic troubleshooting issues happens due to improper validations or even if it is accurately validated, and if touchpoints donâ€™t sync.</p>

<p>This basic issue resolves after removing the Temp and Cache files from the portal and from your system.</p>

<p>Therefore after clearing all this, you need to publish the touchpoints again along with Update Configuration on the agent. 
For E.g. If the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Source Application not Found</code> in the log file appears, the probable cause is due to the presence of the 
Temp and Cache Files.</p>

<h1 id="attributes-and-actions">Attributes and Actions</h1>

<p>While defining a connect to a particular API endpoint in Shopify, you require clear understanding about the data requirements 
and endpoint configurations. You can refer to this document to find all the endpoint details of your shopify installation. 
To define the endpoint in APPSeCONNECT you need to define Actions and Entities. Actions are specifically targetted for a particular 
endpoint while schema is the data needed to execute the API. Here are the list of some of the prepackaged API actions defined 
for you which you can easily plug and play while doing your integrations.</p>
