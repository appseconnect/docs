I"L<p>In todayâ€™s world,organizations are having multiple data sources.With distrubuted architechture in place,these data sources are existing independently and scatteredly.It can be tricky to manage all these datasources alltoghether.</p>

<p>By designing and building an API,one can connect to any data source,be it a Database or any REST API or a SOAP based API and thus can easily manage all these data sources.</p>

<h2 id="steps-to-connect-to-a-data-source">Steps to connect to a data source.</h2>

<p>If you are creating <strong>API proxy</strong> for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">First Time</code>, you are being presented with a Wizard like this.</p>

<p><img src="/staticfiles/api-management/media/HowToConnectDataSource-Wizard.png" alt="How To Connect Data Source Wizard" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>After Providing API Proxy Details and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Inbound Policy</code> details (if applicable) you will get to <strong>Backend Service</strong> tab.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/staticfiles/api-management/media/HowToConnectDataSource-selectapp.png" alt="How To Connect Data Source Selectapp" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Here First you have to choose app to which you want to connect.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/staticfiles/api-management/media/HowToConnectDataSource-appandappversion.png" alt="How To Connect Data Source Appandappversion" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>For example,I have choosen an App called <strong>GenericDatabaseConnect</strong>. Upon selecting the app, you will have to choose
App Version,Protocol,Credential(If provided already), Schema and Action. In my case,I have selected App Version <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.0</code>,
Schema <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OCRD</code> and Action <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Insert</code>.</p>

    <p>If you want to know more about how you can import schema and actions for an app

</ul>

<p>In this way,one can connect to a data source very easily.</p>
