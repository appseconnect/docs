I"—<p>Executing the Process is a vital part when integrating any applications. This section of the document will let the users understand how the integration process can be executed through workflow for adding customers from Magento2 to SAGE  300.</p>

<h2 id="brief-description">Brief Description:</h2>

<p>Here, the Customer is used for syncing multiples customers from <a href="/connectors/Magento2/">Magento2</a> to <a href="/connectors/sage300/">SAGE 300</a>. A <a href="/transformation/handling-dependent-data/">Post-Task</a> Address Add is also attached for syncing customer address to SAGE 300. A workflow is designed and executed with the Customer Add touchpoint where Customers are being added to SAGE 300 from Magento2. The customer is created in Magento 2 and is synced to the SAGE 300.</p>

<p>Login to Magento 2 Application and <a href="https://docs.magento.com/m2/ce/user_guide/customers/account-create.html">add customers</a> in Magento2.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Navigate to the Workflow Panel in the agent and click on the <strong>Start Sync Button</strong> for executing the Process.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting:</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Remote Server returned an error: (409) Conflict.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Resolution:</strong> You may have faced this error because of a lookup which has not been successfully transformed. Verify in the transform file whether the value of lookup mapped attribute is transformed or not. If not, you need to rectify your mapping, or you need to add new lookup table for this connection.</p>

<p>Following the above procedures, you can successfully sync customer from Magento 2 to SAGE 300.</p>
