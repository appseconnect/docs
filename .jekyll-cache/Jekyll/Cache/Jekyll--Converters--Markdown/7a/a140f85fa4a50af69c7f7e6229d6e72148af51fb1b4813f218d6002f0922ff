I"ö<p>License key-based authentication approach is security enhancement for your on-premise and cloud integrations. 
This mechanism authenticates users who tries to login to the integration client of APPSeCONNECT agent using 
a revocable, secure and unique license or a security token that is provided by the server.</p>

<h3 id="working-principle-for-license-management">Working Principle for License Management</h3>

<ul>
  <li>When registered users logs in for the first time, the server verifies the authentication, and generates a licence key based on machine credentials.</li>
  <li>APPSeCONNECT tags each local system with the licence key such that the same licence key cannot be used from different system.</li>
  <li>License key will be revocable and traceable, i.e. it can be removed or revoked when the subscription gets expired and renewed further.</li>
  <li>Each License key is generated considering the Organization ID and MacID which enhances the security of your application preventing unauthorized access.</li>
  <li>License Key is not dependable on Username and Password as the Auto-Sync services will remain active even if the password is changed. The License key once assigned, cannot be resigned again by changing the Username/Password.</li>
  <li>The feature Rolling Window will provide Partners and Developers an access to client agent environment. Read to know more about <a href="/license%20management/license-generation/">Rolling Window</a>.</li>
  <li>Multiple OP Agent instances can be set as primary after license key implementation.</li>
  <li>License Key once generated will stay valid till the time user subscription is valid.</li>
  <li>Multiple users of the organisation will now be able to login to same as well as different agent environments.</li>
  <li>A user of an organization will not be able to login to the same environment, if that user is already been linked with any other organization.</li>
  <li>Every agent associated with an organisation, will have separate license key for each agent instances in each environment.</li>
  <li>While updating to Agent Version 4.9.0 &amp; Above, Ensure to run the migration tool for Agent Upgradation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note: (a) Agent needs to be dissociated first from the portal, before reassigning the same license key.  <br />
        (b) APPSeCONNECT License Management is compatible even with older versions of the agent</strong></p>

<h3 id="usability-aspect-of-license-management">Usability Aspect of License Management</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If the user who had access to the license key, leaves the organization. 
Each connected organisation will have a separate key and it is simpler to track unauthorized connections.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>License key implementation feature prohibits access to different organization from same environment 
and this restriction is presently available from Agent 4.4 onwards.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scenario: If user 1 from organization 1 have already logged in to an Agent environment, user 2 of organization 2 will not be able to 
log in to the same Agent environment.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Whenever a different organization user tries to login to same machine, they will get the following message:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/staticfiles/root/media/user-licensekey-failure.png" alt="user-licensekey-failure" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>On-behalf login for client by the superuser will be stopped in OP Agent.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE: No implementer/partner/developer will be able to login separately for an organization which was available 
  for all earlier Agent versions of 4.3 and lower.However, the above Implementer/Developers can login using 
  <a href="/license%20management/license-generation/">Temporary license</a> key to access other organisation environments.</strong></p>
