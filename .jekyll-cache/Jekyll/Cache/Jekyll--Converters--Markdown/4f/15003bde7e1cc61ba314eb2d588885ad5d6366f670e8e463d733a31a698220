<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Lookup Mapping</code> is an important function under touchpoint selection. 
Value mapping is a concept which allows the implementer to configure value mapping specific to the application environment such that when the source value is processed, it will be transferred to the destination value automatically. The Value-Mapping is a way to map the special values which needed to be converted by the applications during <a href="/transformation/overview/">transformation</a>.
Details of Value Mapping will come in subsequent section of the document.</p>

<h2 id="copy-connection">Copy Connection</h2>

<p>This Feature enables the user to copy the connections that was previously created. This not only copies the connection but also

<h2 id="default-notification-for-transactions">Default Notification for Transactions</h2>

<p>As we go on improving and deploying the integration, a number of failures you might encounter. Some are based on
incorrect logic which misses a particular data structure that needs improvement on the connector, or else some 
related to application specific implementation issues. With APPSeCONNECT, we provide daily transaction reports 
emailed to you by default, once you setup the connector and execute it on your profile. Even though you can 
setup this section to send you multiple emails per day according to the schedule defined by you, you will get daily
notification on the amount of transactions being performed through APPSeCONNECT.</p>
