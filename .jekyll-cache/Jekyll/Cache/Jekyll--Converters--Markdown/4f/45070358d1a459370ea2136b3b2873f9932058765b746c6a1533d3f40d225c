I"ù<p>When working with Process Flows, it is essential to map the attributes and the entities of both source and destination applications, for synchronizing data.
Process flow <a href="/processflow/designer-processflow/">designer inteface</a> gives you the space to design your business flow
and do the node configurations of the applications and trasformation activities all in one go</p>

<p>In Process Flows, you need to drag the mapper node and link up the application nodes for activating the Node Configuration window 
of the Mapper Node, as shown in <a href="/processflow/creating-processflow/">process flow creation</a> section</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites-for-working-with-mapper-node">Prerequisites for working with Mapper Node</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You should have valid credentials to the portal.</li>
  <li><a href="/processflow/designer-processflow/">Design</a> a process flow or need or do mapping on the existing process flow.</li>
  <li>Link both Source and the Destination application with the Mapper Node 
for activating the Node Configuration window of Mapper Node.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="steps-to-work-with-mapper-node">Steps to work with Mapper Node</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Login to the Portal and Navigate to the Process Flow Section from <a href="/processflow/processflow-listing-page/">Process Flow Listing Page</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="/processflow/creating-processflow/">Create a New Process Flow</a> or Edit an existing Process Flow in the <a href="/processflow/designer-processflow/">Designer Page</a>.</li>
  <li>Start with linking  the Source and Destination app with the mapper node.The Node configuration Window of Mapper Node opens.

  <li>In the Node Configuration Window of Mapper Node, you will be to view the 
<a href="/transformation/getting-started-with-mapping/#structure-of-mapping">structure of the mapper</a>node.</li>
  <li><a href="/transformation/getting-started-with-mapping/#structure-of-mapping">Structure of Mapping</a>will help you know provide a 
basic walkthrough of the Mapper Node.</li>
  <li>To work with Mapper node, you need to know about the <a href="/transformation/understanding-components-of-mapping/">components of Mapping</a> or Mapper node. 
<img src="../../../staticfiles/processflow/media/mapper/mapper_2.png" alt="Mapper 2" /></li>
  <li>Variables are one such component which are necessary when working with 
Mapper Node. To know more, view <a href="/transformation/types-of-variable/">types of variables</a> used in APPSeCONNECT.
<img src="../../../staticfiles/processflow/media/mapper/mapper_3.png" alt="Mapper 3" /></li>
  <li>Mapper node focuses on mapping of attributes with Source &amp; Destination
applications. To know more, view <a href="/processflow/customising-attribute-mapping/">steps to Customize Attribute Mapping</a></li>
  <li>Mapping/Mapper of Processflows requires the usage of Library functions for transforming data from Source to Destination. <br />
To know more, view the <a href="/transformation/using-library-methods/">Appresource functions</a>.</li>
  <li>You can also implement logic over attributes using IF condition. <br />
To know more, view <a href="/processflow/steps-to-define-logic-over-destination-mapping/">implementing IF condition</a> in attribute mapping.<br />
8.Lookups maps specific value that are required to transform. <br />
To know more on repository, view <a href="/processflow/implementing-lookup-in-mapping/">Lookup Repositories</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Following are the steps and necessary links that are required to work with the Mapper node of Process Flow.
For executing a sync process user needs to execute the following tasks in mapper node.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Providing Xpath in For Each loop</li>
  <li>Creating &amp; Mapping Root Variables and Root Entity Variable for fetching complex values.</li>
  <li>Defining Namespaces</li>
  <li>Mapping Attributes</li>
  <li>Implementing If Condition in various level - Attribute Level, Complex Object Level, Complex Object Collection Level.</li>
</ul>
