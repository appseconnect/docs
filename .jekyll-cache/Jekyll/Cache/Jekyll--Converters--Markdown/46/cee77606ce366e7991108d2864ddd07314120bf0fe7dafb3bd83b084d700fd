Those who wish to deploy APPSeCONNECT platform, on-premise mode has the elasticity to run their integration processes by deploying the agent(s) behind the firewall, thereby obtaining greater control on where their data resides.
APPSeCONNECT recognizes that many users need their integration processes to communicate with applications that operate behind corporate firewalls for various security and regulatory compliance reasons.
APPSeCONNECT system architecture accommodates to both scenarios: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">On cloud integration processes or On Premise behind corporate firewalls</code> to safeguard that corporate data does not get visible to the cloud.</p>

<p>APPSeCONNECT comprises of mainly two components.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cloud/Web</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Agent</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>It is a hybrid solution which can centralize your application(s) communication logic, business logic, and your custom data into configurable endpoints (also called as Touchpoints), 
which will eventually be downloaded to the APPSeCONNECT thin clients installed on your local server to transform your business data between applications</p>

<p>The server is configured with pre-defined templates which can provide you with a ready-made one-click solution to map basic business requirements with all functional endpoints between apps, 
while APPSeCONNECT also gives you an option to customize both the pre-defined touchpoints and/or new touchpoints to map your own business processes.</p>
