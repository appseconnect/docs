  <li>You are now in the <a href="/processflow/designer-processflow/">designer</a> section.</li>
  <li><a href="/processflow/creating-processflow/">Create</a> a Process Flow. Once you have created the process flow, click <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SAVE</code> button on the right area of top pane.
<strong>When a user is creating a new Process Flow for the first time, only <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SAVE</code> button will be available.</strong>    <br />
<img src="\staticfiles\processflow\media\pfdelete2.png" alt="pfdelete2" /></li>
  <li>Now you can view the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DELETE</code> button which will be available next to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SAVE</code> button.    <br />
<img src="\staticfiles\processflow\media\pfdelete3.png" alt="pfdelete3" /></li>
  <li>You can delete a process flow just after saving by clicking on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Delete</code> button. A pop up will appear 
to run the process of deletion as shown below.  <br />
<img src="\staticfiles\processflow\media\pfdelete4.png" alt="pfdelete4" /></li>
  <li>If you wish to <a href="/processflow/deploying-and-executing-processfloww/">deploy</a> the Process Flow in any environment you can proceed with the 
deployment option. Once the process flow is deployed, if you try deleting the process flow without undeploying it, you get the 
following message. <br />
<img src="\staticfiles\processflow\media\pfdelete5.png" alt="pfdelete5" /></li>
  <li>To finally <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Delete</code> a deployed process flow, go to the<a href="/deployment/Environment-Management/">Environment</a> section to <a href="/processflow/deploying-and-executing-processfloww/#undeploy-process-flow-from-environment">Undeploy</a> 
the process flow from the environment.    <br />
<img src="\staticfiles\processflow\media\pfdelete6.png" alt="pfdelete6" /></li>
  <li>Now come back in the designer section, to carry on the process of deletion of process flow.<br />
<img src="\staticfiles\processflow\media\pfdelete7.png" alt="pfdelete7" /></li>
  <li>On clicking on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DELETE</code> option, a Confirmation message will be displayed. Click <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Yes</code> to proceed and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">No</code> to Cancel the deletion process. <br />
<img src="\staticfiles\processflow\media\pfdelete8.png" alt="pfdelete8" /></li>
</ol>

<p>The above steps will aid the deletion of processflow and User will be redirected to the Process Flow <a href="/processflow/processflow-listing-page/">Listing page</a>.</p>

<p>Users also get the option to delete a process from the listing page. If the process flow is deployed in an environment, you will be unable to perform the 
delete operation as shown below.<br />
<img src="\staticfiles\processflow\media\pfdelete9.png" alt="pfdelete9" /></p>

<p>Undeployed process flows can be deleted from the listing page by clicking on the delete button as shown below.<br />
<img src="\staticfiles\processflow\media\pfdelete10.png" alt="pfdelete10" /></p>

<p>The deleted process flow moves to trash folder.</p>
