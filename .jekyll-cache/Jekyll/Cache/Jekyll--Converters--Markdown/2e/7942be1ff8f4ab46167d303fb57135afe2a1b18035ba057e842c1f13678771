<h2 id="process-to-configure-oauth-10-in-rest-adapter---oauth-10">Process to configure Oauth 1.0 in Rest Adapter - Oauth 1.0</h2>
<p>Follow the process given below to configure the OAuth 1.0 in the On-Premise Agent.</p>
<ol>
  <li>You need to open the On-Premise Agent. By default you can view the Apps Configuration Page.</li>
  <li>Beside the chosen app, Click on the Plus (+) symbol. Here Twitter is chosen as it supports Oauth 1.0 authentication.
<img src="../../../../staticfiles/connectors/media/technology-connector/OAuth1-Rest1.png" alt="OAuth1 Rest1" /></li>
  <li>The REST App configuration window opens. Select the type Oauth 1.0 from drop down of the Authentication Tab.<br />
<img src="../../../../staticfiles/connectors/media/technology-connector/OAuth1-Rest2.png" alt="OAuth1 Rest2" /></li>
  <li>You can now view the fields for Oauth 1.0 authentication configuration.<br />
<img src="../../../../staticfiles/connectors/media/technology-connector/OAuth1-Rest3.png" alt="OAuth1 Rest3" /></li>
  <li>Provide the field details of the application you are using. The following are the field details that the user needs to provide for validating the Generic REST adapter for OAuth 1.0.
    <ul>
      <li>Base URL - You need to provide the base URL of the application that you are using here.
<strong>Here in Twitter the Base URL can be found by generating a Resource URL in its API Documentation.</strong></li>
      <li>Consumer Key - A key to obtain authorization from the user which is generated in the application.</li>
      <li>Consumer Secret - A secret key that establishes the ownership of the Consumer Key generated by you.</li>
      <li>Request Token URL -  This URL obtains an unauthorized Request Token.</li>
      <li>Authorization URL - This URL obtains the user authorization for Consumer access.</li>
      <li>Access Token URL - The URL used to exchange the User-authorized Request Token for an Access Token</li>
      <li>Call Back URL - This is the secondary URL required for data restoration.</li>
      <li>Client Username - Username of the application you are using.</li>
      <li>Client Password - Password of the application you are using.</li>
      <li>Signature Method - This is a security protocol used by the application you are using.</li>
      <li>Realm (Optional) - This is an optional field that defines the protection realm of the application.
<img src="../../../../staticfiles/connectors/media/technology-connector/OAuth1-Rest4.png" alt="OAuth1 Rest4" /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click on the Content-Type Tab and select the type of file that the application handles â€“ XML, JSON.
 <strong>Currently REST Adapters handles two file types - XML &amp; JSON</strong><br />
<img src="../../../../staticfiles/connectors/media/technology-connector/OAuth1-Rest5.png" alt="OAuth1 Rest5" /></li>
  <li>Navigate to the Authentication tab. Click on Validate button.
<img src="../../../../staticfiles/connectors/media/technology-connector/OAuth1-Rest6.png" alt="OAuth1 Rest6" /></li>
  <li>You will be redirected to the login screen of your application. Provide the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">username</code> and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">password</code> 
  of your application. <br />
<strong>Here we have used the application Twitter. Therefore, you can view the twitter 
login page.</strong>  <br />
<img src="../../../../staticfiles/connectors/media/technology-connector/OAuth1-Rest7.png" alt="OAuth1 Rest7" /></li>
  <li>You will be redirected to the URL you provided as the Call Back URL. 
Navigate to the On-Premise Agent and click on the Generate Token Button.<br />
<strong>Note: You need to keep the browser open where you were redirected to the Call 
Back URL while generating the token.</strong>  <br />
<img src="../../../../staticfiles/connectors/media/technology-connector/OAuth1-Rest8.png" alt="OAuth1 Rest8" /></li>
  <li>Click on the validate button after generating the token.  <br />
<img src="../../../../staticfiles/connectors/media/technology-connector/OAuth1-Rest9.png" alt="OAuth1 Rest9" /></li>
</ol>

<p>Following the above given process, you successfully validate the  REST Adapter of Oauth 
1.0 authentication in On Premise Agent.</p>
