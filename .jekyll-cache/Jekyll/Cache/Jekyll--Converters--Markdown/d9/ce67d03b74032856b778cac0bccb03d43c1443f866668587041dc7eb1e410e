I"t<p>APPSeCONNECT requires connectivity to the application such that it can retrieve or send data to the application or data sources. In addition to pre-packaged connectors, which are readymade and easy to use, we also support 
technology connectors, which are developed taking in mind on standard protocol based adapters for custom applications. But in certain scenarios you might want to develop this connectivity 
from scratch as it might be a scenario in your case where the application does not fall into any of the solutions we provide as pre-packaged. Your application might be having 
non-standard API endpoint, it might be dependent on some OnPremise environmental resources or even your service might not have 
an Technology connect present in APPSeCONNECT platform, in all these scenarios, you are left with defining a completely new connect to the application
yourself.</p>
