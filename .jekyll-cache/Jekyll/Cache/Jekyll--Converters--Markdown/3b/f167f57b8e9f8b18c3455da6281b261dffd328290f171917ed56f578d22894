  <li>Navigate to the touchpoint after login, for which the Mapping is to be done.</li>
  <li>Click on the Transform button on the touchpoint you have selected. The user will now be able to view the Transform screen of that touchpoint.</li>
  <li>Expand the Transform node till the Complex Objects and the ComplexObjectsCollections are visible.<br />
<strong>Note: In this case the touchpoint Business Partner add is used for the connection Magento2 and SAP B1.</strong></li>
  <li>In the ComplexObject <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BPAddresses</code>, XPATH has been provided for mapping the attribute Street.<br />

<strong>Note: The XPATH should be provided based upon the INPUT packet generated after the sync process. As a prerequisite, the touchpoint should be synced for viewing the XML nodes structure hierarchy.</strong></li>
  <li>The XPATH mapped is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{ {street/item[1]} }</code>. [1] indicates the first position instance of the node item under 
the element street shall be accessed.</li>
