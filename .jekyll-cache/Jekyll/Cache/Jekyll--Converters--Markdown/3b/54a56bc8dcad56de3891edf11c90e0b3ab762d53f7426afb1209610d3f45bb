with the advanced graphical interface of processflow.</p>

<h2 id="benefits-of-migration-to-processflows">Benefits of Migration to Processflows</h2>

select application in the interface and continue with the operation.</p>

<p>2) CUSTOMIZE AND EXTEND BEST PRACTICES</p>
<ul>
  <li>Build customized business-related flows and templates to use it across departments for best practices.

  <li>Eliminates Manual work &amp; reduces human error</li>
</ul>

<p>4) Quick &amp; Easy Deployment at one go <br />
5) Bundling of Processflows (Packaging) are available which can be
shared across organisation. 
7) Enhanced Check features for Unfinished Deployment &amp; Redeployment.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites-for-migrating-workflows-to-processflow">Prerequisites for Migrating Workflows to Processflow</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You need to have valid credentials for login into the portal.</li>
  <li>You need to have workflows designed/executed for migration to process flows.</li>
  <li>Ensure the workflows are in active state before migrating.</li>
  <li>Inactive workflows are not migrated.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="steps-to-migrate-workflows-to-processflow">Steps to Migrate Workflows to Processflow</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The first step to migrate your workflow to process flow is to share your Organisation Id with the implementer.</li>
  <li>Ensure the workflows are in active state before migrating.  <br />
<img src="\staticfiles\processflow\media\migratedpf-active-wf.PNG" alt="migratedpf-active-wf" /></li>
  <li>Once your workflow is migrated to processflow you can view them under ProcessflowÂ»Migrated-Workflow
folder, under Processflow listing page.    <br />
<img src="\staticfiles\processflow\media\migrated-pf-listing.PNG" alt="migrated-pf-listing" /></li>
  <li>Click on the folder to view your migrated workflows to processflow, enlisted there.</li>
  <li>You can Edit/Delete the migrated processflows, by clicking on Action menu.
<img src="\staticfiles\processflow\media\edit-migratedpf.PNG" alt="edit-migratedpf" /></li>
  <li>Now this migrated workflow will behave similar to the processflow and you can 
edit the Processflow from teh <a href="/processflow/designer-processflow/">designer</a> section and carry on with the <a href="/processflow/deploying-and-executing-processfloww/">deployment</a> process.</li>
  <li>The migrated workflow to process flow should contain all the mapping dataâ€™s as provided in workflow</li>
  <li>You can make any mapping/configurational changes in the migrated processflow per requirement.</li>
  <li>You can also rename the migrated processflow in the designer section.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>NOTE: (a)  Suppose your Organisation has ten workflows, and you want to migrate four workflows out of all.
In this instance, you need to make those four workflows active and rest six needs to be in inactive
mode. Else either ten workflows (if active state is enabled) will get migrated to processflows. Or if none of the 
workflows are in active stage, they wonâ€™t get migrated.<br />
(b) Presently there is no migration support for Workflows implemented with Webhooks, Email &amp; Filter Node</strong></p>
