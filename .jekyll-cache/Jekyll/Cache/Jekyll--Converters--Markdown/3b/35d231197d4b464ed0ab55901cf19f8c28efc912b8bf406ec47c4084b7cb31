I"◊/<p>Executing the Process is a vital part when integrating any applications. This section of the document will let the users understand 
how the integration process can be executed through workflow for adding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Business Partner</code> from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Magento2 to SAP Business One</code>.</p>

<h2 id="brief-description">Brief Description</h2>

<p><img src="/staticfiles/integration/media/workflow-bpadd.png" alt="workflow-bpadd" /></p>

<p>Here, the Touchpoint <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Business Partner</code> is used for syncing multiples customers from <a href="/connectors/Magento2/">Magento2</a> to <a href="/connectors/Sap-Business-One/">SAP Business One</a>. 
A workflow is designed and executed with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Business Partner Add</code> touchpoint where Customers are being added to SAP Business One from Magento2.</p>

<p>The Business Partner is created in Magento 2 and is synced to the SAP Business One.</p>

<p>Login to Magento 2 Application and <a href="https://docs.magento.com/m2/ce/user_guide/customers/account-create.html">add customers</a> in Magento2. The screenshot is given below.    <br />
<img src="/staticfiles/integration/media/addcustomer-magento.png" alt="addcustomer-magento" /></p>

<p>Also for any Business Partners, if there are any <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Contact persons</code> that need to be added or updated the process would happen simultaneously as a Post-Task activity. 
See here to know more about the <a href="/transformation/handling-dependent-data/">Touchpoint dependencies</a>. See here to know the agent validation in <a href="/connectors/Magento2/#configure-the-magento-application-in-the-agent">Magento2</a> and
<a href="/connectors/Sap-Business-One/#configure-the-sap-business-one-application-in-the-agent">SAP Business One</a>.</p>

<p>Also, if there is no requirement for adding or updating Contact person, only the Business Partner Touchpoint can be executed to sync the customers to SAP.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:If the customer is of B2C, only the business partner workflow is needed to be synced. And if the customer is B2B, contact person update is also needed to be synced.</strong></p>

<h2 id="lookup-mapping">Lookup Mapping</h2>

<p>The lookup Mapping for the STATE field is needed to be done if the state code does not match with the state code provided in Magento2.</p>

<p>For Example: If STATE provided in Magento2 is New York, the lookup Mapping is needed to be done where destination code is NY for New York.</p>

<p>Given below is the image of the Lookup Up Mapping for the given scenario.
<img src="/staticfiles/integration/media/lookupmapping-BPADD.png" alt="lookupmapping-BPADD" /></p>

<p>On mapping the lookups, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">attribute mapping</code> for State field under the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ComplexObject BPAddresses</code> is needed to be altered. 
The mapping for the attribute is given below:
<img src="/staticfiles/integration/media/lookupmapping-BPADD2.png" alt="lookupmapping-BPADD2" /></p>

<p>Steps to do this Mapping is proved below:</p>

<p>a.	Open the State attribute and click on the function [genericlib:getMapping(ObjectType,Value)]  which is available under Functions &gt; Generic Functions.           <br />
b.	The Object type in the function is the Lookup type that has been provided in the Lookup Mapping i.e State.           <br />
<strong>Note: State being a string object needs to be provided in single quotes.</strong>               <br />
c.	The value is the xpath for the State field in the xslt.</p>

<p>On completion of the mapping, click on the Submit button.                       <br />
<strong>Note: After the mapping changes, Reset Generate and Reset Publish the Touchpoint. Also click on the Update Lookup tables and Update Configuration in the Agent</strong></p>

  <li>The Resync Panel show the Success Result in the agent.          <br />
<img src="/staticfiles/integration/media/resyncpanel.png" alt="resyncpanel" /></li>
  <li>The User can also trigger or <a href="/workflow/deploying-and-executing/">deploy the workflow</a> from the cloud Portal by clicking on the run button.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="integration-data-survey">Integration Data Survey</h2>

<p>The user can survey the data by viewing the <a href="/workflow/list-of-snapshot/">Processed Snapshot</a>  from the node level of the workflow.    <br />
<img src="/staticfiles/integration/media/integration-data-survey.png" alt="integration-data-survey" /></p>

<p>This Snapshot View displays the successful execution of the workflow. The Business Partner with the source id 184 is successfully synced
to W184 in SAP Business One.</p>

<h2 id="post-conditions">Post-Conditions</h2>

<p>The user can see the data synced in the SAP Business One by viewing the Business Partner Module in the SAP Application.</p>

<p>Open the SAP Business One application and navigate through the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Module &gt; Business Partners &gt; Business Partner Master Data</code>. 
The Module Opens, Press * to view all the business partners present.
<img src="/staticfiles/integration/media/bpmaster-data.png" alt="bpmaster-data" /></p>

<h2 id="frequency-of-use">Frequency of Use</h2>

<p>The user can execute the Integration through workflow as and when required for data integration.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If the Lookup mapping is not done in the provided manner, the STATE of the business partner might not sync. The error shown is ‚ÄòState Code is not Defined‚Äô. To troubleshoot this, Login to the portal and navigate 
to the workflow -&gt; Process -&gt; Mapping and initiate the lookup mapping.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the Master data needs to be synced so to fetch the information from both ways. Skipping the process will not fetch any data from the 
   source application and no result will be shown in the resync bucket.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>CServiceData::SetPropertyValueString failed; Value too long in property <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CardCode</code> of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BusinessPartner</code><br />
  <img src="/staticfiles/integration/media/troubleshooting-sapmage2.png" alt="troubleshooting-sapmage2" /></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Solution: The parameter passed in the mapping of the attribute CardCode is too long for it to execute the transformation process. 
Users need to map the attribute with Short string value passed to the parameter. Users are suggested to provide 3-4 letter string value to the mapping.</p>
