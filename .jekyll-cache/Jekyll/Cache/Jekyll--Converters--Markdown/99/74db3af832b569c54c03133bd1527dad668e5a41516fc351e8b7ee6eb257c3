I"<p>If the user wants to perform some ACTIONS based on the type 
of events encountered during agent execution such as - Execution Failure, Application Crash, Execution Start, 
execution end, that can be done using APPSeCONNECT Rules.</p>

<p>During an occurrence of any event as such as application crash, the rule against that event 
if created and its action associated with the rule, will be triggered automatically.</p>

<p>Presently rules are categorized into two types:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Pre-Configured Rules: These are prebuilt and prepackaged rules provided by the APPSeCONNECT and can be activated and used
by the user. To know more,read <a href="/rule/choose-rule/">Choose Rule Button</a>.</li>
  <li>Default Rules: These rules are configured by the APPSeCONNECT itself, and will automatically be 
triggered if any events occurred according to its criteria. <br />
