<p><img src="\staticfiles\processflow\media\packageinstall4.PNG" alt="packageinstall4" /></p>

<p>5) The installed packages will be placed as a Sub-Folder, within the default folder named <strong>Installed processflow</strong> under the processflow node in the <a href="/processflow/processflow-listing-page/">processflow Listing page</a>.</p>

<p>6) By default the sub folder will named as per the package name. By clicking on the sub folder, you view the list of all the Processflows that was bundled with the package.</p>

<p><img src="\staticfiles\processflow\media\packageinstall5.PNG" alt="packageinstall5" /></p>

<p>7) Once installed, you can successfully <a href="/processflow/deploying-and-executing-processfloww/">deploy and execute</a> the shared Processflows on your organisation.</p>

<p>Following the above process, you can successfully install the shared packages and execute the shared Processflows within those packages.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>While installing the package for the first time, if a <strong>different package with same name already exists</strong>, you will get to rename the package before the first installation.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reinstalling-packages">Reinstalling Packages</h2>

<p>This section will guide you with the reinstallation of the packages on your organisation. The <a href="/processflow/processflow-package-installation/#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a> for the reinstallation process, is same as that of installing a package for the first time.</p>

<p>1) To reinstall the package, navigate to My Packages and choose the folder for which the package needs to be reinstalled.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Packages created on your organisation will be available on <strong>My Packages</strong> folder.</li>
  <li>Packages that are shared with you will be available on <strong>Shared With Me</strong> folder.</li>
</ul>

<p>2) The process to reinstall Packages remains same as that of installing packages. You can reinstall your Packages in two ways as mentioned while <a href="/processflow/processflow-package-installation/#installing-packages">installing Packages</a> for the first time.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/processflow/processflow-package-installation/#install-from-actions-column">Install from Actions Column</a></li>
  <li><a href="/processflow/processflow-package-installation/#install-from-view-packages">Install from View Packages</a></li>
</ul>

<p>3) Click on the install button against the package that you need to reinstall.</p>

<p><img src="\staticfiles\processflow\media\reinstall3.PNG" alt="reinstall3" /></p>

<p>4) You will be getting a confirmation message informing <strong>Seems like you have already installed “Your Package Name”. Are you sure you want to reinstall “Your Package Name”.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Yes: Your package will be reinstalled</li>
  <li>No: The reinstallation process will be declined.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="\staticfiles\processflow\media\reinstall4.PNG" alt="reinstall4" /></p>

<p>5) On accepting the confirmation option, your package will be reinstalled. You can view the loaded screen of the installation process. 
As reinstalling will create the sub-folder having the same name as that of the package, which is already available in prior.
By default, you will be provided with the “Package Name (n)” where <strong>n</strong> stands for sequence number of the installation of the package is reinstalled. However you can anytime <a href="/processflow/processflow-package-reinstallation/#renaming-the-installed-packages">rename</a> the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Third Level Sub-Folders</code> inside <strong>Installed Processflows</strong> as per your choice.</p>

<p><img src="\staticfiles\processflow\media\reinstall2.PNG" alt="reinstall2" /></p>

<p>Following the above process you can successfully Reinstall your packages.</p>

<h2 id="viewing-installed-packages-from-installed-processflow-folder">Viewing Installed Packages from Installed processflow Folder</h2>

<p>1) Navigate to Designer &gt; processflow &gt; <a href="/processflow/processflow-packaging-overview/">Package Library</a> to view the details of the packages available on your organisation.</p>

<p>2) On installing, you will be created with a <strong>Sub Folder with the same name as that of the package</strong> inside <strong><a href="/processflow/processflow-listing-page/#installed-process-flows-folder">Installed Processflows</a></strong> folder. 
Clicking on the Sub folder will provide you with the details of the number of Processflows available on that sub-folder.</p>

<p><img src="\staticfiles\processflow\media\reinstall1.PNG" alt="reinstall1" /></p>

<p>3) Expanding the created Sub folder, you can view multiple <strong>sub-folders on a level below</strong>. This folder will contain the Processflows that were packaged within.</p>

<p><img src="\staticfiles\processflow\media\reinstall5.PNG" alt="reinstall5" /></p>

<p>4) The multiple sub folders are the reinstalled packages that are available on that level of the tree.</p>

<p>Following the above steps you can successfully view Installed Packages from the Installed processflow folder.</p>

<h2 id="renaming-the-installed-package-folders">Renaming the Installed Package Folders:</h2>

<p>You will be able to rename you installed packages any time. This section will enable you to Rename the installed packages.</p>

<p>1) All the Installed packages are listed within the Default Folder <a href="/processflow/processflow-listing-page/#installed-process-flows-folder">Installed Processflows</a>. Only Sub-folders in the third level <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(Installed Processflows &gt; Package Name (Parent Folder) &gt; Package Name (Subfolders having the package Processflows))</code> will be allowed to RENAME.</p>

<p>2) Clicking on the Ellipses of the third level subfolders, you will be available with RENAME option. The Rename box appears.</p>

<p><img src="\staticfiles\processflow\media\reinstall6.png" alt="Reinstall6" /></p>

<p>3) Provide the name and click on the SAVE button.</p>

<p><img src="\staticfiles\processflow\media\reinstall7.png" alt="reinstall7" /></p>

<p>4) On saving, you can view the changes inside the <a href="/processflow/processflow-listing-page/#installed-process-flows-folder">Installed Processflows</a> tree.</p>

<p><img src="\staticfiles\processflow\media\reinstall8.png" alt="reinstall8" /></p>

<p>Following the above process you can successfully RENAME the installed package folders</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation is mandatory to use packaged Processflows.</li>
  <li>All the node configurations and mapping done in processflow will be shared when sharing the package to other organisation.</li>
  <li>Modifications made in the Processflows in source organisation <em>after the sharing</em> , the changes will not reflect once the package is shared to an another organisation.</li>
  <li>As processflow doesn’t stores any credentials, you will not have to worry about credentials vulnerability.</li>
  <li>Processflows that are shared, if deleted from the folder <strong>Installed processflow</strong>, will move to the TRASH folder. However, you can anytime restore those Processflows from TRASH. The Processflows will be restored in the <strong>processflow</strong> folder.</li>
  <li>You cannot rename with a same name in the same tree level.</li>
  <li>You cannot delete any installed package folders.</li>
</ul>
