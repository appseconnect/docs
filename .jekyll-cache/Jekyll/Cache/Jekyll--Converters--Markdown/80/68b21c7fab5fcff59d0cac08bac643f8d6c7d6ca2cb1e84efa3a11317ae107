I"<p>APPSeCONNECT processflow allows you to create variables that captures certain values that can be reused in any part of the processflow or in any other processflows designed within your organisation
Variables are used to store data so that it can be used within a Node or the processflow. With Capture Variables you will not have to provide expressions and generic function multiple times, 
instead you can define a capture variable with the required expression and deploy it anywhere within the processflow or any other processflow.</p>
