I"´<p>Application configuration is an integral activity prior to the process of integration. 
If your chosen application is SAP Business One, credentials need to be provided for 
validating the agent.
Here you will find the detailed description on how to configure the agents for the 
application of SAP Business One, attributes and action, and the Troubleshooting issues.</p>

<p><strong>Note: This document is for the SAP Business One version &gt;=8.8</strong></p>

<h2 id="prerequisites-for-sap-business-one-configuration">Prerequisites for SAP Business One Configuration</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Select the application SAP Business One in the <a href="/getting%20started/configurations/#process-of-choosing-app">APPS</a> section of the APPSeCONNECT Portal.</li>
  <li>Create and publish a <a href="/getting%20started/configurations-for-integration/#configuring-connector-while-creating-connection">connection</a> in the cloud portal.</li>
  <li>Update the Configuration in your On-Premise AEC Agent. You will find your Connection present in the agent.To Know about Agent Configuration, <a href="/deployment/Deployment-Configuration/">Click here</a></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note: if you are working with custom connector (per business need), custom touchpoints are needed to be created</strong></p>

<h2 id="configure-the-sap-business-one-application-in-the-agent">Configure the SAP Business One Application in the Agent</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Open APPSeCONNECT Agent by providing correct credentials.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the connection page of APPSeCONNECT Agent, you will see the connection is created in APPSeCONNECT Cloud.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/sapb1-agent1.png" alt="sapb1-agent1" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Click on the credentials icon to provide SAP B1 credentials to validate the connection.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/sapb1-agent2.png" alt="sapb1-agent2" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Provide the credentials of SAP B1</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/sapb1-agent3.png" alt="sapb1-agent3" /></p>

<p>Under SAP Event XML file path &amp; SAP Image file path, you need to create two folders respectively and link the path to it. 
This path later needs to be provided in SAP B1 as well.</p>

<p><strong>Follow the steps mentioned below, to provide SAP Event XML file path &amp; SAP Image file path in SAP B1</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Open SAP B1 after providing valid credentials.</li>
  <li>Navigate through Administrator &gt; System Initialization &gt; General Settings.</li>
  <li>A form will open. Select ‚ÄúPath‚Äù menu under it. Browse for SAP Event XML file path and Image path.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/sapb1-agent4.png" alt="sapb1-agent4" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>After providing all the credentials. Click ‚ÄúSave‚Äù button.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/sapb1-agent5.png" alt="sapb1-agent5" /></p>

<p>A message ‚ÄúConnection Data Saved‚Äù will appear if all the credentials provided by you for SAP B1 is valid.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click on the ‚ÄúValidate‚Äù button, to validate the connection.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/sapb1-agent6.png" alt="sapb1-agent6" /></p>

<p>A message ‚ÄúTest Connection Successful‚Äù will appear if all the credentials provided by you for SAP B1 is valid. 
In this way, you can configure the credentials of SAP B1.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

<p><strong>Issue 1: Source Application Data Not Found</strong></p>

<p>‚ÄúSource Application Data Not Found‚Äù even if Data is present is the Source Application.</p>

<p>Some of the basic troubleshooting issue happens due to improper validations or even if it is 
accurately validated and if touchpoints do not sync. This basic issue resolves after removing 
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Temp and Cache files</code> from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">portal</code> and from your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">system</code>. Therefore after clearing all
this, you need to publish the touchpoints again along with <strong>Update Configuration</strong> on the agent.</p>

<p>For E.g. If the ‚ÄúSource Application Data Not Found‚Äù in the log file appears, the probable cause is due 
to the presence of the Temp and Cache Files.</p>

<p><strong>Issue 2: Syncing issues</strong></p>

<p>While working with SAP B1 Integrations, SAP Business One DI Server ON/OFF is needed to be done for proper 
syncing else data will not sync to SAP.</p>

<h2 id="attributes-and-actions">Attributes and Actions</h2>

<p>While defining a connect to an API endpoint in SAP Business One, you require clear understanding about the
data requirements and endpoint configurations. You can refer to this document to find all the endpoint 
details of your SAP Business One installation. To define the endpoint in APPSeCONNECT, you need Actions and Entities. 
Actions are specifically targeted for an endpoint while schema is the data needed to execute the API. 
Here, is the list of some of the pre-packaged API actions defined for you which you can easily plug and play 
while doing your integrations.</p>

<p>SAP Business One being a SOAP based application, it has objects that are used for pushing and pulling the data.
