<p>To configure the Basic Authentication Type for Rest Adapter follow the steps given below:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Login to APPSeCONNECT Portal and go to the app section to choose the desired application (Rest Supported Application).</li>
  <li><a href="/configuring%20appseconnect/configurations/#b-technology-app-creation">Create Technology Application</a> using rest adapter. Choose <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">REST</code> option while creating technology application for REST based protocol.</li>
  <li><a href="/getting%20started/configurations-for-integration/#configuring-connector-while-creating-connection">Create Connection</a> between the application.</li>
</ol>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>Protip:</strong> You can use either both technology app or one tech app and one prepackaged app while creating a connection. 
 Also you need to click <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Configure Connector</code> button for creating connection as your desired connection is made of custom application.</p>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>Protip:</strong> Here you will get a connection for Shopify (REST Supported Application) where you can view the validation
details as required.</p>

<p>Once the connection is created, Login to the agent.
Go to the App Configuration page on your OP Agent and Click on Update Configuration.<br />
You can now view the chosen applications in your agent. Here <strong>SHOPIFY is BASIC AUTH supported Application</strong>,</p>

<p><img src="/staticfiles/connectors/media/technology-connector/Rest-BasicAuthentation-Image1.png" alt="Rest-BasicAuthentation-Image1" /></p>

<p>Click on the + icon beside the shopify app and the following screen appears.</p>

<p><img src="/staticfiles/connectors/media/technology-connector/Rest-BasicAuthentation-Image2.png" alt="Rest-BasicAuthentation-Image2" />.</p>

<p>The Rest api screen contains the following fields:</p>

<ul>
  <li>URL - The URL of the server to connect to. This can be an http or https address but must be URL encoded.</li>
  <li>Authentication - Identifies the secure login type.   <br />
a) No Auth â€” No login information in required.  <br />
b) Basic â€” Basic uses base64 encoding. Because user passwords are not encrypted and the target server is not authenticated, Basic is not a secure authentication.  <br />
c) OAuth 2.0 - OAuth 2.0 is the industry-standard protocol for authorization. The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party
 application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner, or by allowing the third-party application to 
 obtain access on its own behalf.</li>
</ul>

<p>Choose the Authentication Type as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Basic</code> from the drop down list.   The following screen appears<br />
<img src="/staticfiles/connectors/media/technology-connector/Rest-BasicAuthentation-Image3.png" alt="Rest-BasicAuthentation-Image3" /></p>

<p>Input the required details on the basic authentication screen of the REST ADAPTER.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Base URL - Input the Base URL of the Rest Supported APP</li>
  <li>User Name - The user name for authentication.</li>
  <li>Password -  The password for authentication.</li>
</ul>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>Protip</strong> Here the username is the API KEY generated against your PRIVATE APP created on Shopify</p>

<p>The pathway for generating new Private App in Shopify is: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">APP&gt;Manage Apps&gt;Create a New Private app </code></p>

<p>Now click on the Content-Type Tab and the following screen appears .    <br />
<img src="/staticfiles/connectors/media/technology-connector/Rest-BasicAuthentation-Image4.png" alt="Rest-BasicAuthentation-Image4" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Content-Type - This is the content type section that includes the file format types like XML, JSON <br />
Presently the REST Adapter supports two set of content type conversion- <strong>XML and JSON</strong></li>
  <li>Support for uploading sample XML documents to define schema for XML content during REST Adapter configuration.</li>
  <li>Support for uploading sample JSON documents to define schema during REST Adapter configuration.</li>
</ul>

<p>Select the Content-Type from the drop down list. Click on <strong>VALIDATE</strong> and <strong>SAVE</strong> after providing the credentials.</p>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>Protip</strong>  XML documents passed to a REST endpoint that support the XML content type must comply with the
XML schema specified during trigger (inbound) REST configuration. When the REST invokes a target endpoint, 
the XML response must comply with the XML schema specified during invoke (outbound) <br />
REST response configuration.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly go to App Configuration option and enter the server details for the application (here we have choosen
SAP B1 as another application) which is not based on REST API.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click on Validate button for validating the URL.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now Go to the sync panel to run the sync process.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After the validation, the workflows are published for integration between the REST application SHOPIFY and SAP B1.    <br />
The touchpoint is executed for the Sync Process by clicking on the START SYNC NOW button.</p>
