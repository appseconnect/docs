I")<p>APPSeCONNECT provides a number of events which you as a developer can hook into, to write code specially when 
the execution stops at a particular event. Let us take a look at some of the events which appseconnect adapter 
development environment provides :</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>EventName</th>
      <th>EventDescription</th>
      <th>Used from</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="http://isdn.appseconnect.com/html/13C231FD.htm">TaskStarted</a></td>
      <td>The event will allow the adapter to track each individual integration start method</td>
      <td>Initialize block</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="http://isdn.appseconnect.com/html/E9157DE9.htm">TaskCompleted</a></td>
      <td>The event will be generated when any integration task is completed</td>
      <td>Initialize block</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="http://isdn.appseconnect.com/html/D1A05ECF.htm">WorkflowStarted</a></td>
      <td>The event is raised when a dependency workflow is triggered</td>
      <td>Initialize block</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="http://isdn.appseconnect.com/html/160B3CF3.htm">WorkflowCompleted</a></td>
      <td>The event is raised when a dependency workflow is complete</td>
      <td>Initialize block</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="http://isdn.appseconnect.com/html/3C959725.htm">TransformEventHandler</a></td>
      <td>The event is raised after transformation</td>
      <td>Initialize block</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="http://isdn.appseconnect.com/html/3C455B56.htm">RealtimeProcessingStarted</a></td>
      <td>The event is raised when Realtime engine gets a request for processing</td>
      <td>Initialize block</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="http://isdn.appseconnect.com/html/2B0401DA.htm">RealtimeProcessingEnd</a></td>
      <td>The event is raised when a realtime engine executed a request</td>
      <td>Initialize block</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The events are raised whenever the special event occurs during execution of an integration.</p>

<p>To implement the event, it is recommended to use the <a href="http://isdn.appseconnect.com/html/1538BE75.htm">Initialize</a> method of <a href="http://isdn.appseconnect.com/html/73508818.htm">IAdapter</a> interface, if not otherwise, so as to ensure 
the event is not hooked more than once.</p>

<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
<span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">Initialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ApplicationContext</span> <span class="n">context</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">_context</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">context</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">_resource</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">AppResource</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">context</span><span class="p">);</span>

    <span class="n">context</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">TaskCompleted</span> <span class="p">+=</span> <span class="n">Context_TaskCompleted</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">private</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">Context_TaskCompleted</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">IAdapter</span> <span class="n">sourceAdapter</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">IAdapter</span> <span class="n">destinationAdapter</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ExecutionSettings</span> <span class="n">currentExecutionObject</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// your code goes here connecting both the adapters.</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here in the Initialize method of IAdapter interface, we have hooked the event <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TaskCompleted</code>, the method 
will automatically get executed after the execution is completed. By completion, we mean that the data transferred correctly from Source to Target application.</p>

<p>Generally we store the data late when we are not sure whether the data is available beforehand.</p>
