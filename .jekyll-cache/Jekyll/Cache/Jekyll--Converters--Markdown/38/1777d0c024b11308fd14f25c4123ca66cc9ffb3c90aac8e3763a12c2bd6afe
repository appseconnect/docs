I"—<p>Product Release Version: 3.1.0</p>

<p>As per our schedule, we are trying to continuously improve our platform with newer features.
We are coming up with an extended version of APPSeCONNECT SDK giving you a chance to 
interact with more efficiently. The new SDK for APPSeCONNECT, new interactive user interfaces
