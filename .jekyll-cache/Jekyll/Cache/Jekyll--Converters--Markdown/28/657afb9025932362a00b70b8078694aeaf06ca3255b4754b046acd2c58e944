I"–	<p>Deploying and publishing API is one of the primary concern after you have successfully configured 
an API on your API stack. There are various deployment options available on APPSeCONNECT which will 
help you to run an API either on your own Premise or on Cloud dependening on the availability of data. For on premise 
deployments, you need to consider installing our <a href="/deployment/Deployment-Configuration/">on-premise agent</a>, and configure it to be active 
on Environment section of APPSeCONNECT.</p>

<p>To Deploy an API, you need to make sure, all pre-requisites of an API development is met.</p>

<h2 id="pre-requisites-for-deploying-and-publish-apis">Pre-requisites for Deploying and Publish APIâ€™s:</h2>

</ul>

<p>After all these steps are done, make sure the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">environment is kept running</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">credentials are properly updated</code>. 
Once confirmed, you can add new APIs, and do an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Update Configuration</code>, before executing it from Cloud.</p>

<p>You can use <a href="/api-management/steps-to-create-swagger-documentation/">Swagger endpoint URL</a>to call the APIs from APPSeCONNECT portal itself.</p>
