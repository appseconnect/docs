<p>Protocol setup will have two sections:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Either create new protocol on fly which will require them to create protocol file 
  OR</li>
  <li>Select from the generic protocol. The generic protocol will generally have adapter assigned to it, if not the adapter needed to be uploaded to next screen.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can upload/create a Template File. (If you upload a file then it has to be in XSLT format else an error message will be shown).<br />
<img src="/staticfiles/root/media/CustomApp-AddNamespace.png" alt="CustomApp-AddNamespace" /><br />
In the Add Namespace portion, you can add new namespace by filling Prefix and URL field.
The namespaces added to the template file will be applied to root node only during XSLT generation.<br />
Click Continue button, it will direct to the Adapter page.Here you can <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Upload Adapter or Select Adapter</code>.<br />
<img src="/staticfiles/root/media/CustomApp-UploadAdapter.png" alt="CustomApp-UploadAdapter" />
Click Continue button, it will redirect you to the Credential section. After execution of all the steps mentioned above you have created a custom App successfully.
The newly created app, can be viewed in the app listing section.</p>

</ol>

<p><strong>Note: You cannot delete the application if it is associated with any connection.</strong></p>

<h3 id="understanding-schemaentity">Understanding Schema/Entity</h3>

<p>An entity is defined as an object that has a real-world existence. An entity can be a single thing, person, place, or object. For an e-commerce website, Customer, Order, Invoice etc are entities.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data can be stored about such entities.</li>
  <li>Each entity has its own characteristics or attributes. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">customer id</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">address</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">phone number</code> are attributes to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">customer</code> entity.</li>
  <li>Each customer record in the database serves as an entity item.</li>
  <li>The definition of an entity is called its schema. In other words, the structure of an entity is called its schema.</li>
  <li>If a customer is an entity then the complete set of the various fields associated with it is called its schema.</li>
</ul>

<p>Schema Image is given below:</p>

<p><img src="/staticfiles/root/media/Schema.png" alt="Schema" /></p>

<h3 id="understanding-schema-attributes">Understanding Schema Attributes</h3>

<p>In APPSeCONNECT, an attribute is a property or characteristic of a schema. If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">customer</code> is a schema, 
then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">customer name, email, address</code> etc. are defined as attributes.  Before defining a schema you need to have a 
proper understanding of the various data fetched via API so that you can define schema properly and provide the 
required attributes.</p>

<p><img src="/staticfiles/root/media/attribute.png" alt="attribute" /></p>

<p>The attributes can be of various types.</p>

<ul>
  <li>String -  This type of variable is used when you want to store a string value.</li>
  <li>Bool - This type of variable is used when you want to store a boolean value like true or false.</li>
  <li>Date Time - This type of variable is used when you want to store a date time value.</li>
  <li>Number - This type of variable is used when you want to store a numeric value.</li>
  <li>Double - This type of variable is used when you want to store a floating point or double value.</li>
  <li>ComplexObject - When you store an attribute as a collection of several child attributes it is a ComplexObject. For example, if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">address</code> is an attribute,
then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Street line 1, Street line 2, City, Pin</code> would exist as child attributes thus making <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">address</code> a complex object.</li>
  <li>ComplexObjectCollections - A ComplexObjectCollection may be defined as a collection of complex objects.</li>
</ul>

<p>Assume that a customer has two shipping addresses. The first address is based in Delaware and 
the other in California. Each address contains the Street Name, Building name, PIN code etc. 
Thus each address would be stored as a complex object attribute. Let the addresses be stored as 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">address1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">address2</code>. Now these addresses would be stored as child attributes to the 
parent attribute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">address</code>. Thus <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">address becomes a ComplexObjectCollection</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/staticfiles/root/media/complexobject-collection-attribute.png" alt="complexobject-collection-attribute" /></p>

<h3 id="understanding-custom-attributes">Understanding Custom Attributes</h3>

<p>There might be business requirements to create Custom Fields during the creation of 
mapping where the base mapping does not provide an attribute that you are looking for. 
APPSeCONNECT allows you with a feature where you can add your own 
custom attribute and map that with the data coming from the attribute at the other end.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-actions">Understanding Actions</h3>

<p>Actions are nothing but defining certain tasks like getting data from an application or sending data to an application based on certain conditions and these conditions are defined through an action filter.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you want to fetch customer(s) data from an eCommerce site and in APPSeCONNECT you define a Customer entity for that.
Now for getting data we can define an action name called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET</code>. When you define an action for an entity you need to provide certain information</p>

<ul>
  <li>Action Name: Name of the action. In some predefined application many adapter logics are written based on this data.</li>
  <li>Action Description: This is the Description of the action. At the time of touchpoint creation actions are selected based on this description.</li>
  <li>Action Filter &amp; Resync Filter Details</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="understanding-schemas-and-actions-of-an-application">Understanding Schemas and Actions of an Application</h3>
<p>The user can view the schemas and the action present or can also add schema and add action for each application. 
This section enables the user to view and add the Schema and its Actions.</p>

<p><em><strong><a href="/transformation/working-with-schemas-action-filter/">Click</a> to know more about the process to add Schemas, attributes &amp; Actions.</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>The User needs to have a valid AEC account.</li>
  <li>An application is needed to be select for defining the Schemas and its Actions.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Login to the APPSeCONNECT Portal with valid credentials.</li>
  <li>Move into the APPS Page and <a href="/configuring%20appseconnect/configurations/#process-of-choosing-app">Choose any application</a>.</li>
  <li>Click on the + sign after adding the application and click on Schema.(In this case, MS Dynamics NAV has been taken for the instance).
<img src="/staticfiles/root/media/Select-Schema.png" alt="Select-Schema" /></li>
  <li>On the Schema Window, the user can view the schemas present or can also add schemas present for the ADD Schema Option.<br />
<img src="/staticfiles/root/media/Add-Schema.png" alt="Add-Schema" /></li>
  <li>The Actions inside a schema can be viewed by clicking on the + sign. The ADD ACTION option is provided for Adding Actions inside a Schema.
<img src="/staticfiles/root/media/Add-Action.png" alt="Add-Action" /></li>
</ol>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>Protip:</strong> Default Schemas would only be present for the Pre-packaged APPS.</p>

<h3 id="adapter">Adapter</h3>
<p>Adapters helps in integration with other applications easy. Adapter represents an interface between an APP and APPSeCONNECT. An adapter is a component which connects your app with APPSeCONNECT. <a href="/connectors/Version-Extraction-For-Adapter-Upload/">Click</a> to know about the steps to Add adapter for an application in an organisation.</p>

<p>There are few responsibilities of an adapter which are defined as under:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a credentials view which allows connecting to the respective APP where you want to connect.</li>
  <li>Create Push and Pull method inside the adapter which can send and receive data to and from the application.</li>
  <li>Add additional business behavior with respect to the corresponding app.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Adapter is loaded dynamically by the <a href="/deployment/overview/">Agent</a> and calls some specific methods using a fixed contract defined as an interface.</p>

<h3 id="extension">Extension</h3>
<p>Extensions, on the other hand, are the applications which add an extra feature into the E-commerce/ERP platforms making them capable to work with the APPSeCONNECT agent. When an app supports extension, it enables customization.</p>

<h3 id="functions">Functions</h3>
<p>The APPSeCONNECT expression methods are special transformation block used during <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mapping</code>. The platform provides a bunch of helper functionalities which can be used during mapping/action filters/rules etc. These functions can either be provided through the platform, or you can write one as an independent Software Vendor. The three different types are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Generic</li>
  <li>Native</li>
  <li>Cloud App Resource</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="\staticfiles\root\media\appfunctions.png" alt="Appfunctions" /></p>

<p>Here you will get the details of <a href="/transformation/using-library-methods/">Appresource Functions</a> of APPSeCONNECT</p>

<h3 id="protocol">Protocol</h3>

<p>This section is only available for the custom application and technology application. Follow the instructions below to create Protocol Methods for your application.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>You need to have valid credentials to the portal.</li>
  <li>You need to create a <a href="/configuring%20appseconnect/configurations/#a-create-custom-app">custom app</a> or a <a href="/configuring%20appseconnect/configurations/#b-technology-app-creation">Technology app</a> to access the protocol section.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Steps to work with Protocol Methods:</strong></p>

<p>Protocol Add screen is for creating or updating the existing protocol. An user will be able to add more protocols to the existing app such that the same can be used for implementer’s connections. So, to Add or Update protocol you must follow the steps written below:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Navigate to the app section and expand the node of the created custom or tech app to view the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Protocol</code> button.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="\staticfiles\root\media\protocoladd1.png" alt="Protocoladd1" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>You can view the window that lists the prepackaged protocols if any. Click on the <strong>Add Protocol</strong> button.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="\staticfiles\root\media\protocoladd2.png" alt="Protocoladd2" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>The Protocol add window opens. You will get the following fields in the window. Click on the SAVE button after providing the inputs.
    <ul>
      <li>Protocol Name (Mandatory Field).</li>
      <li>Checkbox for parallel execution</li>
      <li>Checkbox for default execution</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="\staticfiles\root\media\protocoladd3.png" alt="Protocoladd3" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>You can successfully view the created protocol in your window. Expand the node and click on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Add Method</code> button.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="\staticfiles\root\media\protocoladd4.png" alt="Protocoladd4" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>On the method window, you to provide the name of the protocol <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">method</code> and the token from the drop down. Once selected click on the SAVE button.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="\staticfiles\root\media\protocoladd5.png" alt="Protocoladd5" /></p>

<p>Following the above process, you can successfully create a protocol for an Technology or a Custom app.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Each protocol can have protocol methods under them. You can create more than one method for a protocol.</li>
  <li>Multiple methods can be added to a protocol, each of which allows XSLT Templates.</li>
  <li>Protocol template can be defined.</li>
  <li>Protocol delete will not work if the same protocol is used in a touchpoint.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="delete">Delete</h3>
<p>Clicking on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Delete</code> button will remove the application from your application list. However, can anytime choose the deleted application from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Choose App</code> list. Also for custom and technology application, you can delete the applications for the drop-down availble beside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VIEW</code> button.</p>

<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> You will be restricted from deleting the any application that is already in use.</em></p>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>ProTip:</strong> Please choose the category correctly because depending on your choice, you might be allowed to add Connectors. This portal do not support connectors between Apps in the same group (As that won’t process any business requirement). For instance, migration jobs from SAP B1 to SAP ECC will not be supported at this time.</p>
