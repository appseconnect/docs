<p>When setting up the environment for the sync process, the environment for selected agent displays the message <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Agent is Disconnected</code>. Also, while logging in to the OP agent, 
it displays the message <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Agent is Blocked</code>. This is due to the reason that the agent has been detached from the portal.</p>

<p><strong>Steps to Troubleshooting:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Login to the portal and navigate to Manage &gt; Environment.</li>
  <li>The <a href="/deployment/Environment-Management/">environment listing</a> page opens. Click over the environment which is disconnected and is needed to be connected.</li>
  <li>Click on the Attach button visible at the top right corner of the page, to reactivate the environment</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Upon attaching the environment from the portal, restart and login to the agent on your local system.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the settings page of the agent and Activate the autosync. On activating the autosync, your environment will connect with the portal.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: (a) Without activating the autosync or if the autosync is off, your environment in portal would remain as disconnected. Before troubleshooting this scenario verify, whether your Autosync is activated or not.  <br />
      (b) Old agent users would get the message as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Your agent is deactivated</code>. Please contact the administrator while logging in to OP Agent. <br />
          The steps to troubleshoot the error is common to this scenario. Old agent users could troubleshoot easily following the above given steps.</p>
