  <li>Login to the APPSeCONNECT Portal with valid credentials.</li>
  <li>Go to <strong>MANAGE &gt; APPS</strong>  and <a href="/getting%20started/configurations/#process-of-choosing-app">Choose any application</a></li>
  <li>Click on the + sign after adding the application and click on the Schema button<br />

Option and Import Schema Option. <br />
<img src="/staticfiles/Transformation/media/importing-schema2.png" alt="importing-schema2" /></li>
  <li>Clicking on the Import button, a Pop-up will appear where the user can import XML, JSON, WSDL (Web Services Description Language) 
file for the Schema.
    <ul>
      <li>In JSON and XML format the user needs to choose the respective XML and JSON file saved locally, but in WSDL format the user needs to provide the WSDL file link for importing the schema</li>
      <li>For generic apps, WSDL option will not be available for import to any protocol other than SOAP.<br />
<img src="/staticfiles/Transformation/media/importing-schema3.png" alt="importing-schema3" /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For the XML/JSON format, the user needs to upload the file that supports the respective formats. For XML, the user needs to 
upload XML file and for JSON, the JSON file needs to be uploaded.</li>
  <li>The parent node of provided in the file is needed to be provided in the ELEMENT field.<br />
<img src="/staticfiles/Transformation/media/importing-schema4.png" alt="importing-schema4" /><br />
In this case, the parent is items, therefore the Element should be items.  <br />
<img src="/staticfiles/Transformation/media/importing-schema5.png" alt="importing-schema5" /></li>
  <li>Click on the Display button, to view all the complex object &amp; complex object collection and its attributes.

<strong>Note:</strong>
    <ul>

  <li>Click SAVE button, after all the details has been made.</li>
  <li>Right Click on the created attribute in the node structure, for Renaming and Deleting the attribute.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="actions">Actions</h2>

<p>Actions are nothing but defining certain tasks like getting data from an application or sending data to an application based on certain conditions and these conditions are defined through an action filter.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you want to fetch customerâ€™s data from an eCommerce site and in APPSeCONNECT you define a Customer entity for that, now for getting data we can define an action name, called â€˜GETâ€™. 
When you define an action for an entity you need to provide certain information</p>

<ul>
  <li>Action Name: Name of the action. In some predefined application, many adapter logics are written based on this data.</li>
  <li>Action Description: Description of the action. At the time of touchpoint creation, actions are selected based on this description.</li>
  <li>Action Filter &amp; Resync Filter Details</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Action Filters</strong></p>

<p>The important part of an action is defining an action filter where we can define the conditions based on 
which data will be fetched. The criteria we define here need to follow the filter parsing logic or the rules to read the 
specific set of information from source XML/json file. Action filters are added in a hierarchical node structure against an Action.</p>

<p>An example of defining action filter is; You want to fetch customers from eCommerce based on the creation date which is greater 
from a certain date range then action filter will be like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Request - Body/Header. If you donâ€™t provide any value, it sends the information in the body.  If we select the header 
then that information must be written within the adapter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Operator - condition (greater than, less than, equal, not equal etc.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Value - Based on which the condition will be evaluated. You can provide any string here. Also, you can use an Appresource 
function in filter criteria. The pattern of using it is like this ~{CreatedDate}~ . Here â€˜CreatedDateâ€™ is the function 
written in native Appresource. Here the CreatedDate value returns the last stored date time value for the currently 
executing touchpoint where that action filter used.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you create multiple nodes or conditions then you will get an additional field:</p>

<p>Conjunctions - And/Or [$Node1 + $Node2]</p>

<p><img src="/staticfiles/Transformation/media/actionfilter-image.png" alt="actionfilter-image" /></p>

<p><strong>Error Filter</strong></p>

<p>Error filters are the same as the action filters. They are written for syncing erroneous data which are present in APPSeCONNECT error log bucket or the resync bucket. Based on the logic implemented in adapter code you need to specify the error filter.
For explanation purpose, sample filter for SOAP API has been taken, where a hierarchical node structure is maintained for filtration.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a new node</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/staticfiles/Transformation/media/actionfilter.png" alt="actionfilter" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>After creating a new node, you will be able to do the following things</p>

    <p>a) Create another node (as a child of the parent node).
 b) Rename the created node.
 c) Delete the created node.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a sample filter for Order Add has been taken, you will get the information in a key-value pair. Fill in the details for the
key-value pair &amp; Complex filters as required.</p>
  </li>
