I"&<p>Application configuration is an integral activity prior to the process of integration. If your chosen application is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shipstation</code>, 
credentials need to be provided for validating the agent. Here you will find the detailed description on how to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">configure the agents</code>
for the application of Shipstation, Troubleshooting issues and the attributes and action.</p>

<p>Shipstation is a REST Application which supports both the BASIC authentication. The Adapter of the application Shipstation provides 
the leverage to communicate and adapt with the AEC Portal. This section provides you the detailed process of validating the 
credential of the application Shipstation.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

<p><strong>ISSUE 1:Source Application Data Not Found</strong>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Source Application Data Not Found</code> even if Data is present is the Source Application.</p>

<p>Some of the basic troubleshooting issue happens due to improper validations or even if it is accurately validated, and if touchpoints do not sync, 
this basic issue resolves after removing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Temp and Cache files</code> from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">portal</code> and from your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">system</code>. Therefore, after clearing all this publish the 
touchpoints again along with <em>Update Configuration</em> on the agent.</p>

<p>For E.g. If the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Source Application Not Found</code> in the log file appears, the probable cause is due to the presence of the Temp and Cache Files.</p>

<p><strong>ISSUE 2:Syncing Issues</strong></p>

<p>While working with SAP B1 Integrations, SAP Business One DI Server ON/OFF is needed to be done for proper syncing else data 
will not sync to SAP Business One</p>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>ProTip:</strong> For the integration between Shipstation and SAP Business One, no Addons needed to be installed in SAP. 
However, for the integration between these application, UDFs needed to be created for the touchpoint <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Business Partner Download</code>
as per the business requirements.</p>

<h2 id="attributes-and-actions">Attributes and Actions</h2>

<p>While defining a connect to a particular API endpoint in Shipstation, you require clear understanding about the data requirements and endpoint configurations. 
You can refer to <a href="https://help.shipstation.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026140851">this</a> document to find all the endpoint details of your shipstation installation. 
To define the endpoint in APPSeCONNECT, you need Actions and Entities. Actions are specifically targetted for a particular endpoint while schema is the 
data needed to execute the API. Here are the list of some of the prepackaged API actions defined for you which you can easily plug and play while doing your 
integrations.</p>
