   a. Base URL: This is the base URL of the ZOHO CRM Application.</p>

<p>b. Client ID: This generated from the application site of ZOHO CRM. If Base URL is in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.com format or .in format or in other format</code>, 
      client ID should be generated from the same format as given in Base URL and vice versa.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

<p><strong>ISSUE 1:</strong>
Some of the basic troubleshooting issue happens due to improper validations or even if it is accurately validated,
and if touchpoints do not sync, this basic issue resolves after removing the Temp and Cache files from the 
portal and from your system. Therefore after clearing all this publish the touchpoints again along with 
Update Configuration on the agent.</p>

<p>For E.g. If the Source Application Not Found in the log file appears, the probable cause is due to the presence of the Temp and Cache Files.</p>

<p><strong>ISSUE 2:</strong></p>

<p>For syncing Quotes or Quotation from ZOHO CRM to Uniconta, Lookup mapping is to be done for the field tax. 
The values for the lookup are provided below.</p>
