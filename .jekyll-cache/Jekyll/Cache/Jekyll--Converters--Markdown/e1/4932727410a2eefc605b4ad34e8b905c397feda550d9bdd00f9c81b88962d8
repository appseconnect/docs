<h2 id="whats-new-in-administration">Whats ï»¿Newï»¿ In ï»¿Administration</h2>

<p>If you are an ISV, Implementer or developer, you will enjoy the following offerings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In our last release, we have introduced you with the Workflow to have a feel of 
APPSeCONNECT graphical solution for handling your business process. This time, we 
enhanced this feature further to reduce the complexity and deliver better results 
with minimum effort.The redesign is centered around two core area: to have a better 
control of the synchronizing touchpoints and to speed up the synchronization process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can now have a better control over the execution of your business activities through workflow by using delay, halt and resume features which lets you defer a certain process for a specific amount of time or even change the execution order of business processes. The elements will allow the implementer to orchestrate the business process based on their requirements. Earlier our workflow were designed for sequential execution, one activity at a time i,e you get a record,process it and then send it to your destination application. Once the entire operation is complete, then only the next process will start. Though the design was straightforward, it causes lag between first and next execution. In the new version of workflow we introduced Self loop feature, to handle recurrence of selected activity for finite no. of times. This feature has not only improved workflow performance but has resulted in faster synchronization.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can easily manage the execution order of elements in a workflow using Pre and Post links. This feature has optimized the process of workflow execution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>We also did revamping of our Workflow UI to have a better edge over navigation, action assignments, order of execution etc.</li>
  <li>Our Administration portal is continually growing. You will be happy to know that we have included drag and drop feature for code snippets which will help the developers to quickly find common code to tweak a functionality.</li>
  <li>Implementers and Sales can now collaboratively manage their clientâ€™s subscription through subscription calculation feature. They can have clear visibility of the total amount client needs to pay for their integrations.</li>
  <li>We have also given face lift with unique functionalities to some of our existing Administrations screens such as project specific action filter and touchpoint pages.</li>
</ul>

  <li>Quick Order feature - This feature is more on personalizing the shopping experience for our B2B customers. B2B consumers mostly place orders for common items regularly and in bulk, so they prefer an easy way where they can place order quickly, so that they can move on to their other important tasks.</li>
