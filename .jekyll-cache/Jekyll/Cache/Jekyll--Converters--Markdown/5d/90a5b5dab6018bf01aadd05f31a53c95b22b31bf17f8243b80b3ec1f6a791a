<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Element Name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="/workflow/working-with-get/">Get</a></td>
      <td>The element GET is used for fetching data from the source application by using the API provided by the application</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="/workflow/working-with-process/">Process</a></td>
      <td>PROCESS node is used for transforming data from one format to another format based on the mapping logic specified for that touchpoint</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="/workflow/working-with-post/">Post</a></td>
      <td>POST node is used for pushing data to an application based on the API provided by the destination application</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="/workflow/working-with-halt-resume/">Halt-Resume</a></td>
      <td>HALT node is implemented to halt the execution of the current node and the flow is transferred to another touchpoint/node. Once the Workflow engine gets notified with the RESUME node, the halted process would start again. HALT and RESUME nodes are used in a combination</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="/workflow/working-with-delay/">Delay</a></td>
      <td>DELAY node is used to delay or stop an execution flow for a specific period</td>
    </tr>
