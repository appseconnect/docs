I"9<p>Transformation is one vital concept when it comes to integrating applications. Errors can make the Integration process go wrong and may also have redundant data. Therefore, its always feasible to have some tips and tricks when handling these vital concepts.
This section of the document provides few tips and tricks which can be helpful in implementing 
the Mapping Process.</p>
