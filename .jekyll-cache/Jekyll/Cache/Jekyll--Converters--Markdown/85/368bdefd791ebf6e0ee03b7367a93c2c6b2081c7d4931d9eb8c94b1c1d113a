I",<p>APPSeCONNECT REST Adapter provides a detailed way for consuming external RESTful APIs including secure APIs.</p>

<p><strong>COMMUNICATION BETWEEN CLIENT AND SERVER IN REST ADAPTER</strong></p>

<p>In the REST architecture, clients send requests to retrieve resources, and servers send responses
to these requests. Given below is the process to make requests and send responses.</p>

<p>The rest api authentication types for AEC presently are:</p>

<p>a) <strong>No Auth</strong> - No login information in required.</p>

<p>b) <strong>Basic</strong> - <a href="/connectors/BasicAuthentication/">Basic</a> uses base64 encoding. Because user passwords are not encrypted and the target server is not authenticated, Basic is not a secure authentication.
  Here you have to select the Authentication type as `Basicâ€™.</p>

<p>c) <strong>OAuth 2.0</strong> - <a href="/connectors/OAuth2.0/">OAuth 2.0</a> is the industry-standard protocol for authorization. The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party
   application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner, or by allowing the third-party application to 
   obtain access on its own behalf.</p>

<p>Rest Supported Authentication type details are given below:</p>
