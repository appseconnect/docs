through rendering. In case of Complex Attribute Mapping, Rendering makes the 
procedure easy and adaptable to the environment.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites-for-adding-render-process-flow-mapper-node">Prerequisites for adding Render Process Flow Mapper Node</h2>

<ul>
  <li>You need to have valid credentials of the portal.</li>
  <li>You need to navigate to the <a href="/processflow/processflow-listing-page/">Process Flow listing page</a> for creating or editing a Process Flow</li>
  <li>You need <a href="/processflow/creating-processflow/">create a Process Flow</a> or Edit an existing process flow for implementing rendered in mapping.</li>
  <li>You need to know about the packet structure of the destination application.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Navigate to the Process Flow designer page and click on the Node configuration button of Mapper Node.

  <li>The Mapper Window opens. Expand the Transformation window, click on the Ellipses (â€¦) beside the button Renderer to view the option Add Renderers in the context menu.

  <li>You can view the Renderer window. Default Rendering is the structure that shows that if there is no rendering, the Default Rendering Structure provided, would be implemented.
<img src="../../staticfiles/processflow/media/mapper/processflow_renderer3.png" alt="Processflow Renderer3" /></li>
  <li>Provide the Renderer Name. The user can click on the button TargetExpressions ([property]) and SourceExpressions ([value]) to get the syntax for mapping. Input the expression as how the rendering needs to be done and Click on the SAVE button.

<strong>Rendering will only be implemented, if the provided expression is supporting the XML standard. 
Structure that does not represents XML structure will display error while saving.</strong></li>
  <li>Navigate to the Schema whose <a href="/processflow/customising-attribute-mapping/">attribute</a> you need to map.</li>
  <li>Open the Attribute to view the mapping window where you need to implement the Renderer. Enable the Checkbox for Choose Renderer &amp; Select the created Renderer from the drop-down. 
<img src="../../staticfiles/processflow/media/mapper/processflow_renderer5.png" alt="Processflow Renderer5" /></li>
  <li>Once the renderer is enabled and selected, click on the SAVE button.</li>
</ol>

<p>Following the process, you can successfully implement Renderer to a mapper node.</p>
