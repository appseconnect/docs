I"WJ<p>Created or Edited processflows needs to be deployed to the environment in order to execute the integration process. 
Users, now need not have to update configuration every time for deploying every change made in the processflows. 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DEPLOY</code> button enables the user to automatically deploy the changes in the environment as well as assign the 
credential for the applications that is used in the processflows.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>1)	Should have valid credentials for logging in to the APPSeCONNECT portal.</p>

<p>2)	<a href="/processflow/processflow-app/">APPS</a> should be chosen from the apps section, for proceeding with the design of processflows.</p>

<p>3)	The <a href="/processflow/designer-processflow/">designed</a> processflow should be saved before deploying it to the environment.</p>

<p>4)  If you are deploying the processflow to the On-Premise environment, you need to check the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Enable Environment</code> checkbox in the Agent Settings as Active.</p>

<h2 id="deploying-processflows-to-environment">Deploying processflows to Environment</h2>

<p>1)	Login to the portal and navigate to the processflow module available on the left menu.</p>

<p>2)  Choose the processflow which is already designed and was saved or you can <a href="/processflow/creating-processflow/">create a processflow</a></p>

<p>3)  Click on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">edit button</code> available for the selected processflow, which will navigate the user to the processflow Designing Page. Click on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deploy button</code> in the processflow Designing Page.</p>

<p>4) The Deploy wizard opens on clicking the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Deploy</code> button. The deploy wizard is divided in to three sections.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Select Environment:</strong> You need to select the type of environment (Cloud or On-Premise) for deploying the processflow.</li>
  <li><strong>Set up Connection:</strong> You need to select the credential for the applications selected in the processflow provided in the Agent.</li>
  <li><strong>Select lookups:</strong> You need to fix up the lookups mapped for the attribute in the mapper node.</li>
  <li><strong>Sync &amp; Retry:</strong> You need to configure the Manual/Auto  &amp; Retry execution of the processflow.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note: You can view some explained steps on the Right Side of the Deploy Wizard in the How it 
Works section, that will also help you deploy your processflow successfully.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The below steps are same, if you are deploying your processflow on your **HOSTED</strong> environment.**</p>

<p><img src="../../staticfiles/processflow/media/deploy-processflow13.png" alt="Deploy Processflow13" /></p>

<h4 id="process-to-configure-sync-process---manual-mode">Process to configure Sync Process - Manual Mode</h4>
<p>By toggling the <strong>Select Sync</strong> Toggle to Manual, your processflow will be configured to manual mode of execution. You will not have to configure any details for manual mode of sync process.</p>

<h4 id="process-to-configure-sync-process---auto-mode">Process to configure Sync Process - Auto Mode</h4>
<p>Select Frequency - There are three Options to choose from-  Every Day, Minute &amp; Hour           <br />
(a) If the Frequency selected as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Everyday</code>, you need to provide Interval/Sync Daily 
as shown below:</p>

<p><img src="../../staticfiles/processflow/media/processflow-autosync1.png" alt="Processflow Autosync1" /></p>

<p>(b) If frequency selected as Minute, you can provide input (Only 1-59). You can select End Execution or Never.If you select End Execution, Execution of a process 
flow will stop auto-sync after ‘N’ number of occurrences.  <br />
If your selected option is <strong>NEVER</strong>, processflow will never stop execution.  <br />
<img src="../../staticfiles/processflow/media/processflow-autosync2.png" alt="Processflow Autosync2" /></p>

<p>(c) If frequency selected as Hour, you can provide input (Only 1-23). You can select

<h2 id="executing-deployed-processflow">Executing Deployed processflow</h2>
<p>Execution of a processflow is a vital process for transforming data from one application to another. The basic prerequisites for executing a processflow is given below:
Prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You need to create a processflow. Steps to create a processflow is given here.</li>
  <li>You need to deploy the created processflow or an existing process that needs to be executed. Follow the above steps to know about the process of deploying.</li>
  <li>Environment should be active for the processflow to execute successfully.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="steps-to-execute-a-processflow">Steps to execute a processflow</h3>

      <li>On-Going Operation: Yellow</li>
      <li>Failed Operation: Red</li>
      <li>Successful Operation: Green</li>
