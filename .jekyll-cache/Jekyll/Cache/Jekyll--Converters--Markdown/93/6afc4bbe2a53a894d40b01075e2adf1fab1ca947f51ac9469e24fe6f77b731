Users, now need not have to update configuration every time for deploying every change made in the processflows. 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DEPLOY</code> button enables the user to automatically deploy the changes in the environment as well as assign the 
credential for the applications that is used in the processflows.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>1)	Should have valid credentials for logging in to the APPSeCONNECT portal.</p>

<p>2)	<a href="/processflow/processflow-app/">APPS</a> should be chosen from the apps section, for proceeding with the design of processflows.</p>

<p>3)	The <a href="/processflow/designer-processflow/">designed</a> processflow should be saved before deploying it to the environment.</p>

<p>4)  If you are deploying the processflow to the On-Premise environment, you need to check the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Enable Environment</code> checkbox in the Agent Settings as Active.</p>

<h2 id="deploying-processflows-to-environment">Deploying processflows to Environment</h2>

<p>1)	Login to the portal and navigate to the processflow module available on the left menu.</p>

<p>2)  Choose the processflow which is already designed and was saved or you can <a href="/processflow/creating-processflow/">create a processflow</a></p>

<p>3)  Click on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">edit button</code> available for the selected processflow, which will navigate the user to the processflow Designing Page. Click on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deploy button</code> in the processflow Designing Page.</p>

  <li><strong>Sync &amp; Retry:</strong> You need to configure the Manual/Auto  &amp; Retry execution of the processflow.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note: You can view some explained steps on the Right Side of the Deploy Wizard in the How it 
Works section, that will also help you deploy your processflow successfully.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The below steps are same, if you are deploying your processflow on your **HOSTED</strong> environment.**</p>

<p><img src="../../staticfiles/processflow/media/deploy-processflow13.png" alt="Deploy Processflow13" /></p>

<h4 id="process-to-configure-sync-process---manual-mode">Process to configure Sync Process - Manual Mode</h4>
<p>By toggling the <strong>Select Sync</strong> Toggle to Manual, your processflow will be configured to manual mode of execution. You will not have to configure any details for manual mode of sync process.</p>

<h4 id="process-to-configure-sync-process---auto-mode">Process to configure Sync Process - Auto Mode</h4>
<p>Select Frequency - There are three Options to choose from-  Every Day, Minute &amp; Hour           <br />
(a) If the Frequency selected as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Everyday</code>, you need to provide Interval/Sync Daily 
as shown below:</p>

<p><img src="../../staticfiles/processflow/media/processflow-autosync1.png" alt="Processflow Autosync1" /></p>

<p>(b) If frequency selected as Minute, you can provide input (Only 1-59). You can select End Execution or Never.If you select End Execution, Execution of a process 
flow will stop auto-sync after â€˜Nâ€™ number of occurrences.  <br />
If your selected option is <strong>NEVER</strong>, processflow will never stop execution.  <br />
<img src="../../staticfiles/processflow/media/processflow-autosync2.png" alt="Processflow Autosync2" /></p>

<p>(c) If frequency selected as Hour, you can provide input (Only 1-23). You can select

<h2 id="executing-deployed-processflow">Executing Deployed processflow</h2>
<p>Execution of a processflow is a vital process for transforming data from one application to another. The basic prerequisites for executing a processflow is given below:
Prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You need to create a processflow. Steps to create a processflow is given here.</li>
  <li>You need to deploy the created processflow or an existing process that needs to be executed. Follow the above steps to know about the process of deploying.</li>
  <li>Environment should be active for the processflow to execute successfully.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="steps-to-execute-a-processflow">Steps to execute a processflow</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Once deployed, you need to click on the Execute button in the processflow Designer page.

  <li>The tracker window opens on clicking the EXECUTE button. The Tracker window displays the node specific execution logs and messages as the processflows enters from one node to another.
<img src="../../staticfiles/processflow/media/deploy-tracker2.png" alt="Deploy Tracker2" /></li>
  <li>You can view each step of the operation. Nodes in the processflow will change its colour according to the operation.
    <ul>
      <li>On-Going Operation: Yellow</li>
      <li>Failed Operation: Red</li>
      <li>Successful Operation: Green</li>
