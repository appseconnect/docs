governance to the users for maintaining storage of runtime data, 
viz. transactional logs, process log for a defined time interval.</p>

<p>This will optimize the better utilization of resources in your environment,
thereby allowing lesser footprints on the environment you maintain as well as ours. Thus the local, as well as cloud storage of APPSeCONNECT Agent is optimized for better resource utilization</p>
