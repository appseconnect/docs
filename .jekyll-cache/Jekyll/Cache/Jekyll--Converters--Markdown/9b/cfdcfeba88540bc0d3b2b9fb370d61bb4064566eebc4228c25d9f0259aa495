<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PROCESS</code> node is used for transforming data from one format to another format based on the mapping logic specified for that touchpoint. When we drag a process node in the workflow we need to select a touchpoint. For example, we have a touchpoint which will add a customer from Shopify (ECommerce) to Sap B1 (ERP), so for adding data to SAP B1, we need to convert Shopify data to SAP B1 format. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PROCESS</code> node will do that work depending on the transformation logic written in the touchpoint.</p>
