such that you can clearly implement and optimize the calls made to the APIs. As a developer you can implement 
the adapter in such a way, so that the data is perfectly transferred from one application to another without compormising
performance and also giving most of the flexibility for cloud integrations. Before you move ahead on developing the connector
I hope you have <a href="/sdk/Prerequisites/">installed the pre-requisites</a> correctly on the system and you have all the prebuilt code ready on your visual studio.
Also you need to make sure that you follow our <a href="/sdk/Best-practices/">best practices</a> and <a href="/sdk/Development-Guidelines/">guidelines</a> provided for adapter development.</p>
