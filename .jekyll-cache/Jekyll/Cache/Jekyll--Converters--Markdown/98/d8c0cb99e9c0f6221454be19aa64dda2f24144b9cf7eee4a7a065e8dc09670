I"Y1<p>The user can view the schemas and the action present in an app and can also add schema and add action for application node used in processflow. 
This section enables the user to view, add the Schema, Attributes and the Actions of an application in the Process Flow and managing the same
within a process flow for easy execution. The added schema and its component from the application node will
be visible from the APP Section of the portal as well.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The User should have a valid APPSeCONNECT account.</li>
  <li>APPSeCONNECT should be up and running</li>
  <li>An application node  is needed for defining the Schemas and Actions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="listing-of-schemas-and-attributes">Listing of Schemas and Attributes</h2>

<p>Process flow allows a defined tree view listing structure for managing and viewing
defined Schema, Attributes and Actions associated with it.</p>

<p>To view the listing of Schemas and Attribute,  navigate to the following section: <br />
(a) Go to Portal and click on Process Flow module<br />
(b) Go to <a href="/processflow/designer-processflow/">desiger</a> section and Drag the required App Node<br />
(c) The Node Configuration window opens. Go to General tab and Click <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Manage Schema</code>. <br />
(d) A window opens up and here you can view the listing of all the Schema and Attribute(s) of the Application 
will be displayed in the Tree view on the left pane. 
<img src="../../staticfiles/processflow/media/processflow-schema-listing.png" alt="Processflow Schema Listing" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>The Schemas are arranged in a same level hierarchy whereas the attributes and actions associated with the schema is arranged in the second level 
hierarchy.</li>
  <li>Newly created attribute is arranged under Attribute node.</li>
  <li>The Action Filters and Retry Filters associated with an action are arranged in 
the third level hieararchy under attributes</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE: Any Changes done to the Schema and Attributes from the Portal-Â» App module 
will be displayed in this section.</strong></p>

<p>Thus listing view gives a clear synopisis to the user regarding the Schema access and 
Managementfrom the processflow node configuration level.</p>

<h3 id="adding-schemas-in-an-application-node-of-process-flow">Adding Schemas in an Application node of Process flow</h3>

<p>1) Go to <a href="/processflow/designer-processflow/">designer section</a> and <a href="/processflow/creating-processflow/">create a process</a> flow.<br />
2) Drag the application node and the following  Node Configuration window appears.<br />
3) The field Description is gven below for the Node Configuration section:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Node Description: This denotes the description of the node.</li>
  <li>Node Type: This denotes the type of action that the node needs to perform GET or POST</li>

<h4 id="a-editing-attribute-within-a--process-flow-scope-local-attribute">(a) Editing Attribute within a  Process Flow Scope (local attribute)</h4>

<p>1) Any editing/changes done to an existing Attribute will not change the Attribute defined under the Organization Scope (global).  <br />
You can check the same by navigating to the App section of the portal, where the Schema Attribute(s) under Organization scope (global) will remain unchanged.</p>

<p>(B) To <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Delete Schema</code>, do the following steps:</p>

<p>1) Go to Processflow <a href="/processflow/designer-processflow/">designer</a> section and drag the app node for which you want to deleted schema.

<p>If you have saved the Process Flow (both for Organization and Process Flow Scope)
you will be able to delete the Attribute(s) used in Mapping.</p>
