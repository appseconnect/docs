<ul>
  <li>It is recommended that user should upgrade/install the latest Agent from cloud. Even though we are backward compatible, and older Agents can still communicate with server, we still ask users to upgrade to get full flavour of new features.</li>
  <li>You must have Environment Management privilege to perform actions on the Environment Settings panel.</li>
  <li>By default, on landing up on the environment page, you will be selected with the hosted section. Scroll below to view more details on the Hosted section.</li>
  <li>Enviroments that are available on your organisation, will have the indicators that displays whether the agents are active or inactive for an On-Premise agent.
    <ul>
      <li>RED indicator - Agent is either detached or inactive.</li>
      <li>BLUE indicator - Agent is up and Running.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The will be no colour indicators for an Hosted Agent.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="on-premise">On-Premise</h2>

<p>By default, you will be on the On-Premise section, when landing in the environment page. This section will allow you to know about the On-Premise environments that will be installed on your local server for executing the sync processes.</p>

<p>1) If you are a new user and if you do not have any On-Premise Environment installed, you would get the following view.</p>

<p><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Settings</code> have three available sections for managing OP Agents:</strong></p>

<p>1) Retry Setting - One can schedule resync of failed integrations, where you can provide the start time, 
   no. of iterations and batch size for each resync. Default frequency is daily. To make the resync schedule active,
   you must activate Retry transaction.</p>

<p>2) Log Settings - You can control the way you want to view and store the log in OP Agent from portal now.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If Log in detail is set, then the log will be reflected in .txt files and stored in the same way. If Log in Database is set, then the log will be 
stored in sql lite database and will be reflected in the log bucket.</li>

<p>After saving the changes in settings, the updated information gets auto-reflected in OP Agent.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<p><strong>- Any changes done and saved in the environment settings page of the portal, will get updated in the Settings section of the corresponding OP Agent and vice-versa.</strong></p>

<p><strong>- The environment details page appears only when the autosync checkbox is enabled and activated in the settings of OP Agent as keeping autosync activated keeps the Agent and the Portal connected.</strong></p>

<h3 id="grouping-of-on-premise-environments">Grouping of On-Premise Environments</h3>
<p>This section of the document will allow you to Group multiple OP environments in folders. Grouping is initiated to manage and the arrangement of multiple similar elements for distinguishing its exact purpose. In APPSeCONNECT, for On-Premise environments
, you can group environments in folders as per your requirement. You can view all your created folders on expanding the On-Premise section.
Follow the process below to create folders for grouping.</p>

<p>1) Navigate to Manage &gt; Environments. Click on the Ellipses (Three Horizontal Dots) beside the On-Premise Node to view the option <strong>Create Folder</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="\staticfiles\deployment\media\EasyEnv\opfolder1.PNG" alt="opfolder1" /></p>

<p><img src="\staticfiles\deployment\media\EasyEnv\opfolder2.PNG" alt="opfolder2" /></p>

<p>3) Expand the On-Premise node, to view your created Folder. Clicking on the folder, you will view following page.</p>

<p><img src="\staticfiles\deployment\media\EasyEnv\opfolder3.PNG" alt="opfolder3" /></p>

<p>4) You can Drag and drop the OP environments to the folders for easy arrangements.</p>

<p><img src="\staticfiles\deployment\media\EasyEnv\opfolder4.PNG" alt="opfolder4" /></p>

<p>5) You can perform the following functionalities within a created folder. Click on the Ellipses beside the created folder to view these following option in the context menu.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Add Folder:</strong> You can add a sub folder to your created folder for micro management of the On-Premise environments.</li>
  <li><strong>Rename:</strong> You can anytime RENAME your created folder as per the need of yours.</li>
  <li><strong>Delete</strong> In case the folder is not required, you will be able to delete the created folders anytime.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="\staticfiles\deployment\media\EasyEnv\opfolder5.PNG" alt="opfolder5" /></p>

<p>** You can delete your created folders anytime. On its deletion, all the  On-Premise Enviroments under that folder will be unparented and will shift under the main On-Premise folder.**</p>

<p>Following the above process you can easily create and group your On Premise Environments.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>You can create to max upto two level when creating folders exculding the main <strong>On-Premise</strong>: On Premise &gt; Folder 1 &gt; Sub folder 1.</li>
  <li>You cannot create Folders, Sub-Folders with same name in your organisation. Each name provided for any folders or sub-folders should be unique.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="" alt="detach3" /></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>
<strong>- On detaching the Agent from portal, the On-Premise Agent automatically gets shut down.</strong>
<strong>- Detached Agents, needs to be reattached from the portal for further logging in to it.</strong>
<strong>- Users can anytime delete and detach/attach an inactive agent in the portal.</strong></p>

<h3 id="deleting-environments">Deleting Environments</h3>

<p>You can now directly delete environments that are no longer in use from the listing itself. As soon as you perform delete from portal, the OP Agent instance (active/inactive) gets auto-removed from the local environment and all the associated licenses will get removed.</p>

<p>All the services and sync operations will get stopped. If any new user or different project user logs in further to the same environment, a new license will be generated against it. Follow the below steps to delete an environment (On-Premise or HOSTED).</p>

<p>1) Navigate to Manage &gt; Environments.</p>

<p>2) Click on the ellipses of the environment (On-Premise or HOSTED) which you want to delete. Click on the DELETE button in the context menu that appears.</p>

the deleted agent now will be visible in attached mode in the portal.</strong></p>

<h2 id="environment-view-for-old-agents">Environment View for Old Agents</h2>

<p>APPSeCONNECT License management &amp; environment management is equipped with the full supportability of old agents. However, old agent users are 
restricted from viewing the environment details which is available on for latest agents. Users need to update the old agent for viewing the 
details of the environment.</p>

<p>Old agent will support the complete functionality of the integration process. Old Agent user shall view the environment as given below:
<img src="/staticfiles/deployment/media/RevampedEnv/old-environment1.png" alt="old-environment1" /></p>

<p>The UI will have three buttons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Deploy Configuration: Any changes or modifications made in the portal will be deployed to the OP agent for the sync process when deployed the configurations from the portal.</li>
  <li>Agent Settings: This page has three tabs that configures the setting for the environment.<br />
(a)Log Settings: Log settings captures the details of the Sync process.  <br />
(b)Real Time Settings: Real Time settings is required when working with Real Time touchpoints using <a href="/api-management/steps-to-create-webhook-endpoint/">Webhooks</a> of the API Management.<br />
(c)Resync Settings: Users can enable/disable the Autosync feature of the OP agent in the Resync Settings tab.</li>

<p><strong>Note: (a) Agent status for old agents will be displayed in RED but will have the complete functionality of an Active Agent.<br />
        (b) Users can detach/attach the agents for detaching/attaching the agent</strong>.</p>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>ProTip:</strong> (1) Agent needs to be dissociated first from the portal, before reassigning the same license key. <br />
            (2) APPSeCONNECT <a href="/license%20management/license-management/">License Management</a> is compatible even with older versions of the agent.</p>

<p><strong>Log Settings:</strong> Log settings captures the severity details of the logs that are generated. User can filter accordingly as per severity basis of the logs.
