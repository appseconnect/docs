I"£<p>An integration is generally scheduled at an interval or a specific time such that the data 
is pulled from the application only when the scheduler gets a trigger. Now, sometimes there is
an better way to do an integration only when the application which needs to send data gives us
webhooks. A webhook is a feature in an application that allows the application to put an endpoint 
url which it triggers automatically when some transaction is made on the application end. Or more
precisely, the application is expected to raise an event which the platform can subscribe for and 
when certain action is performed on the application it gets notification about the event.</p>
