I"P<p>Adapter in terms of APPSeCONNECT is a piece of software component external to the application core is plugged in to the system seamelessly such that the
 platform can communicate to the respective application. In case of building an integration between two disparate apps, you need an adapter. Even though if the 
application is following standard protocols, we encourage to use <a href="/connectors/Overview-of-technology-connectors/">prebuild technology connectors</a> which will help in fetching data without requiring to write 
a single lines of code. But in case, you are not sure about the protocol or you want to optimize the connection for the application itself, or even you 
want to remove the complexity from the user while connecting to the application from cloud, adapter development would be your perfect choice down the line.</p>
