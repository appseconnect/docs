I"Ó<p>Executing the Process is a vital part when integrating any applications. This Document will let the users to understand how the 
integration process can be executed through workflow for adding sales order from Magento2 (Multi-store) to Ms Dynamics NAV. 
This document provides the details like the configuration process, required lookup mapping for this workflow to achieve successful sync.</p>
