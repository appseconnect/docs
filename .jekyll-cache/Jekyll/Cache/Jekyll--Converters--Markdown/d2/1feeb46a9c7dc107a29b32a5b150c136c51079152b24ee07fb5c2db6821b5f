  <li>To visit the ENVIRONMENT page in portal, navigate to <strong>Deploy &gt; Environments.</strong></li>
  <li>It is recommended that user should upgrade/install the latest Agent from cloud. Even though we are backward compatible, and older Agents can still communicate with server, we still ask users to upgrade to get full flavour of new features.</li>
  <li>Users having On Premise agents upto <strong>4.3.0.12</strong> will be considered as Old Agents. Users having On Premise agent version <strong>4.4.0.0 and more</strong> will be considered as new agents.</li>
  <li>You must have Environment Management privilege to perform actions on the Environment Settings panel.</li>
  <li>By default, on landing up on the environment page, you will be selected with the hosted section. Scroll below to view more details on the Hosted section.</li>
  <li>Enviroments that are available on your organisation, will have the indicators that displays whether the agents are active or inactive for an On-Premise agent.

<p><img src="\staticfiles\deployment\media\EasyEnv\detach3.png" alt="detach3" /></p>

<p>4) You can anytime re-attach your On-Premise environment by clicking on the <strong>ATTACH</strong> button in the contextual menu.</p>

<p><img src="\staticfiles\deployment\media\EasyEnv\detach4.PNG" alt="detach4" /></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<ul>

  <li><strong>Detached Agents, needs to be reattached from the portal for further logging in to it.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Users can anytime delete and detach/attach an inactive agent in the portal.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="deleting-environments">Deleting Environments</h3>

<p>You can now directly delete environments that are no longer in use from the listing itself. As soon as you perform delete from portal, the OP Agent instance (active/inactive) gets auto-removed from the local environment and all the associated licenses will get removed.</p>

<p>All the services and sync operations will get stopped. If any new user or different project user logs in further to the same environment, a new license will be generated against it. Follow the below steps to delete an environment (On-Premise or HOSTED).</p>

<p>1) Navigate to Manage &gt; Environments.</p>

<p>2) Click on the ellipses of the environment (On-Premise or HOSTED) which you want to delete. Click on the DELETE button in the context menu that appears.</p>
