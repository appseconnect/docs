I"H<p>APPSeCONNECT has its own set of vocabulary or syntax, functions that help its users to customize the pre-defined touchpoints as per the business requirement.</p>

<p>This following section covers the basic syntaxes and the generic functions along with the expressions and examples that should be adhered to while manipulating the touchpoint:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Basic Syntax &amp; Generic Functions in APPSeCONNECT</li>
  <li>File Structures (Input, Transformed, Output XML) after applying the syntaxes and generic function.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note: File Structure will help you in understanding the kind of input or real expression that you can supply 
for mapping, and transformation you can expect from the expression. Usage of the specific generic function, 
as defined,  depends on the application you are integrating.</strong></p>
