nodes in a hierarchical structure as represented in the XML file.</p>

<h2 id="pre-requisites-for-implementing-xpath-in-mapping">Pre-requisites for implementing Xpath in Mapping</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Login to the APPSeCONNECT Portal with valid credentials.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the <a href="/processflow/processflow-listing-page/">Process Flow Listing Section</a>. Here You can view the list of existing Process Flows.</li>
  <li><a href="/processflow/creating-processflow/">Create a New Process Flow</a> or Edit an existing Process Flow.</li>
  <li>If you are using <a href="/configuring%20appseconnect/configurations/#b-technology-app-creation">Tech app</a> and <a href="/configuring%20appseconnect/configurations/#a-create-custom-app">Custom app</a> create the app prior to designing process flow.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Navigate to the processflow from <a href="/processflow/processflow-listing-page/">process flow listng page</a>, for which the Mapping is to be done.</li>
  <li>Click on the Mapper node on the processflow you have selected. The user will now be able to view the Transform screen of that processflow.<br />

  <li>Expand the Transform node till the Complex Objects and the ComplexObjectsCollections are visible.<br />
<strong>Note: In this case the processflow Business Partner add is used for the connection Magento2 and SAP B1.</strong></li>
  <li>In the ComplexObject <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BPAddresses</code>, XPATH has been provided for mapping the attribute Street.<br />
<img src="../../staticfiles/processflow/media/mapper/xpath-mapping-processflow2.PNG" alt="Xpath Mapping Processflow2" /><br />
<strong>Note: The XPATH should be provided based upon the INPUT packet generated after the sync process. As a prerequisite, the processflow should be deployed and executed for viewing the XML nodes structure hierarchy.</strong></li>
  <li>The XPATH mapped is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{ {street/item[1]} }</code>. [1] indicates the first position instance of the node item under 
the element street shall be accessed.</li>
  <li>For easy know-how, view the input packet provided below.

</ol>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>ProTip:</strong> XPATH can be mapped in any entity, be it a ComplexObject, ComplexObjectCollection or an attribute. XPATH can be used for mapping in variables too</p>

<p>The user can view the successful sync of the processflow for the connection Magento2 and SAP Business One.
The user can implement rendering when required for any process flow.
