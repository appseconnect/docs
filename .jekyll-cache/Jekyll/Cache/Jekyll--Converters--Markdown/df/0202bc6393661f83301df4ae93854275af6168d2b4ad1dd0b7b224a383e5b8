<h3 id="hybrid-solution">Hybrid Solution</h3>

<p>APPSeCONNECT is a <a href="http://www.appseconnect.com/appseconnect-a-hybrid-integration/">Hybrid Solution</a>, composition of cloud and on-premise integration solutions. Application Configuration is done in the Cloud, while the Agent software installed on ERP server (i.e. On-Premise), performs the data sync directly between the Client‚Äôs Web Server and ERP Server. Agent‚Äôs configuration can be updated on the Cloud platform. No Customer‚Äôs transaction data gets stored in Cloud, which ensures data security.                                                                                                                                                                            Back To Top</p>

<h3 id="inviting-user">Inviting User</h3>

<p>APPSeCONNECT Web APP feature, that allows creations of more than one registrations depending on the organization size. User‚Äôs subscription which is on organization-basis and this feature allows multiple users to access APPSeCONNECT Cloud portal as per their authorization level and without spending any further expense. <a href="/accessing%20portal/accessing-portal/#users">Click Here</a> to get further information.</p>

<h3 id="inter-process-communication">Inter-process Communication</h3>

<p>APPSeCONNECT feature that allows communication between services without restarting any of the services, For e.g. there are times when APPSeCONNECT Agent needs to send some information to APPSeCONNECT Service, with inter-process communication feature, it can be easily done without the need to restart them.</p>

<h3 id="integration-of-apps">Integration of APPs</h3>

<p>APPSeCONNECT allows smooth communication between 2 independent components i.e. the data from one application could be channelized/synced to other without interruption.</p>

<h3 id="marketplace-integration">Marketplace Integration</h3>

<p>Integration of Marketplace application viz. eBay, Amazon with client‚Äôs ERP application. With APPSeCONNECT, one can automate the bidirectional sync of their business data viz. Order, Payments, Customer, Product etc details of the Marketplace and ERP application.</p>

<h3 id="mapping">Mapping</h3>

<p>It‚Äôs an association of elements between two different data sources. Primarily used for data transformation to moderate the relationship between a data source and the destination in which the data is being used.
It can be between:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Two different APPS</li>
  <li>Entities in two different APPS</li>
  <li>Attributes specific mapping between APP Entities.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="new-connection">New Connection</h3>

<p>Connection specifies the integration between the 2 applications. APPSeCONNECT users can create the single new connection per subscription. For multiple connections, the user has to update their pricing subscription.</p>

<h3 id="on-premise">On-Premise</h3>

<p>Prior APPSeCONNECT came into the picture, the integration solution was provided on client‚Äôs base, the application was installed and all the configurations and settings were done on ERP server. Also the touchpoint specific files were installed locally. The drawback of this solution was that if any disruption or application crash happens when the user has to manually re-install everything along with all the files.</p>

<p>To avoid this problem, APPSeCONNECT offers a hybrid solution where Agent needs to be installed, but all the other information (configuration, credentials, value mapping, touchpoints) can be fetched from the cloud, which remains un-impacted during this situations.</p>

<h3 id="open-source-solution">Open Source Solution</h3>

<p>Open Source Solutions are those where source code is available to the public for modifications. APPSeCONNECT is not an open source solution on itself but it allows integration of open source eCommerce solutions viz. Magento CE with closed source ERP solutions such as SAP B1. Being an Integration Platform, when we configure a connection between an eCommerce and an ERP, APPSeCONNECT uses default APIs of both the platforms. If the eCommerce is an Open Source Solution, then its APIs are also Open Source.</p>

<h3 id="organization">Organization</h3>

<p>The entity that basically describes the Company Account to which the primary registered users belongs. Users belonging to the Company account/or organization have the privilege to access the organization, create/view connections, select and publish touch-points and all the other features of Web Application. This account is required to use the Web Application.</p>

<h3 id="organization-specific-touchpoints">Organization specific Touchpoints</h3>

<p>Touchpoints specific for particular Company Accounts/or Organizations which allow the synchronization of data between the chosen APPs. Different Organizations have a distinct set of connections and touchpoints. For eg. Company A has a connection to SAP B1 and Magento App, whereas Company B have the connection for SAP B1 and Zoho CRM. For both, the organization, set of touchpoints differs as per their chosen apps.                                                                                                                                                                               Back To Top</p>

Other than personal details, the user can also update the passwords and invite users to access their Organization. Please follow the <a href="/accessing%20portal/accessing-portal/#managing-customer-profile">link</a>, for further details.</p>

<h3 id="publish">Publish</h3>

<p>This operation is done on the connections or Touch-points so that configuration data related to connections gets available in the cloud, and Agent which is installed On-Premise fetches this information and users can perform the integration between the entities. During Publish, every configuration that user made in APPSeCONNECT Cloud is compiled to a file stored in a server and is accessible from Agent. The agent becomes fully operational once the connections are published along with its touch-points.</p>

<h3 id="protocol">Protocol</h3>

<p>This is the messaging standards defined for communication between APPS. For creating any APPSeCONNECT Connection, the user has to select the default protocol for establishing the connection. For eg. for creating the connection between Magento and SAP B1, the user has to choose the default protocol for SAP B1 as either DIAPI or DIS or FTP. Again for Magento, the chosen default protocol will be SOAP.</p>

<p>Republishing a touchpoint or connection is done to reflect the configuration change that has been done in the cloud. It is a Repeat Publish, i.e. the connection which has been already published are getting republished to reflect the changes which have not been implemented during the first Publish.</p>

<p>Generally, User has to republish the connection/or specific touchpoints once they found that the Configuration change for the specific touchpoint which they have requested has been resolved so that changes could get visible in the Agent.</p>

<h3 id="role-management">Role Management</h3>

<p>This admin feature is given to the users having Super Administrative privilege to restrict unwanted usage of every feature by APPSeCONNECT users.

<h3 id="what-components-are-generally-available-with-appseconnect">What components are generally available with APPSeCONNECT?</h3>
<p>APPSeCONNECT mostly uses the default APIs available with eCommerce, CRM, Marketplace and ERP systems. Apart from that, APPSeCONNECT has a small software named Agent which is installed within the ERP server. In most cases, Agent is used to configuring and controlling the Integration.</p>

<h3 id="is-appseconnect-an-on-premise-solution-or-a-cloud-solution">Is APPSeCONNECT an On-Premise Solution or a Cloud Solution?</h3>
<p>APPSeCONNECT is a <a href="http://appseconnect.com/appseconnect-a-hybrid-integration/">Hybrid Solution</a> that takes advantage of both the solutions. The configuration and field mapping part of the Integration happens in the Cloud, while the Agent software which is installed in the ERP server performs the data sync directly between the clients Web Server and ERP Server. The Agents configuration can be updated on the Cloud Platform. Thus, APPSeCONNECT does not store the Customers Transactional Data in the cloud and in this way, APPSeCONNECT ensures data security.</p>

<h3 id="is-appseconnect-an-open-source-solution">Is APPSeCONNECT an Open Source Solution?</h3>
<p>No, APPSeCONNECT is not an Open Source solution. Being an Integration Platform, when we configure a connection between an eCommerce and an ERP, APPSeCONNECT uses default APIs of both the platforms. If the eCommerce is an Open Source Solution, then its APIs are also Open Source. However, ERPs (like SAP Business One, MS Dynamics NAV, etc.) are closed source solutions. APIs available within these ERPs can be accessed through technologies like SDK, but these are not Open Source.</p>

<h3 id="which-erp-ecommerce-and-marketplace-platforms-can-be-connected-through-appseconnect">Which ERP, eCommerce and Marketplace Platforms can be connected through APPSeCONNECT?</h3>
<p>Currently APPSeCONNECT has Integration APPS for SAP Business One, MS Dynamics NAV, SAP ECC/All In One in the ERP side; Magento (Community and Enterprise), Zen Cart, Prestashop, Shopify, Big Commerce in the eCommerce side; eBay and Amazon in the Marketplace side; Sugar CRM and Salesforce in the CRM side. This means APPSeCONNECT can connect any of these eCommerce or Marketplace Platforms with any of the above mentioned ERP platforms.</p>

<p>We are also investing our effort in continuous research and development and soon have plans to launch WooCommerce App and Open Cart App in the eCommerce segment. This falls on our short-term roadmap.</p>

<h3 id="how-the-plan-helps-the-consumers">How the Plan helps the consumers?</h3>
<p>The plan helps you to keep track of the services you are consuming and helps APPSeCONNECT to provide you those particular services more efficiently.</p>
