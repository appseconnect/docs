I"ø6<p>Actions are certain tasks like getting data from an application or sending data to an application based on specific API filter conditions known as Action Filters.
Every Schema is an entity that requires to multiple actions to perform multiple operations as per the transaction happening. For Eg: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc.</p>

<p>This section of the document will enable the user to create actions, action filter and error filters under a created schema, when working with processflow.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The User should have a valid APPSeCONNECT account.</li>
  <li>APPSeCONNECT should be up and running</li>
  <li>An application node is needed for defining the Actions.</li>
  <li>The app node needs to be dragged in the <a href="/processflow/designer-processflow/">designer section</a> to define the actions under <a href="/processflow/adding-schema-actions/">manage schema</a></li>
  <li>The <a href="/processflow/adding-schema-actions/#adding-schemas-in-an-application-node-of-process-flow">Schemas should be created</a> under which the Actions are to be defined.</li>
  <li>For defining <strong>Action &amp; Error Filters</strong>, you need to have the ACTIONS created for the chosen application on your organisations. <a href="">Click Here</a> to know more about creating actions.</li>
  <li>You need to have an action filter/retry filter created, to create it as a template.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="adding-a-new-action">Adding a New Action</h2>
