<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

<p><strong>Issue: “BambooHR Login Issue”</strong></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Login Tips for administrators</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>If the employee hire date is in the future, then the employee will not be able to log in to BambooHR. In order to have access the hire date must be today or in the past.</li>
  <li>If you add a new employee and enable access while on the new employee form, but do not add the hire date, the new hire will not get a notification to set up their password. Make sure to always 
  add the employee hire date in order to ensure that the password email is sent. If you would like to make that field required during new hire set up, please <a href="https://help.bamboohr.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">contact a support hero</a></li>
  <li>When you add a new employee and enable him or her with access, be sure the email account with your company has 
  already been set up. If you enable access to BambooHR and the email account has not been created, the email will bounce back to BambooHR and a 
  suppression will be created on the email account, so the user will not receive further emails until it is removed. If this has happened to you, please <a href="https://help.bamboohr.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">contact a support hero</a></li>
  <li>If the employee was previously terminated and then rehired, be sure you have enabled their access upon rehire, so they will be able to log in to BambooHR.</li>
  <li>If the employee has forgotten their password, you can easily send them a <a href="https://help.bamboohr.com/hc/en-us/articles/227484788">password reset</a>or they can send one to themselves on the login page.</li>
  <li>If your company is using Google Mail, check out our <a href="https://help.bamboohr.com/hc/en-us/articles/216836097">Single Sign On integration with Google</a> so your employees can sign in to BambooHR without a password as long as they are currently logged in to their Gmail account.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="attributes-and-actions">Attributes and Actions</h2>

<p>While defining a connect to an API endpoint in BambooHR, you require clear understanding about the data 
requirements and endpoint configurations. You can refer to this document to find all the endpoint details 
of your BambooHR installation. To define the endpoint in APPSeCONNECT, you need Actions and Entities. 
Actions are specifically targeted for an endpoint while schema is the data needed to execute the API. 
Here, is the list of some of the pre-packaged API actions defined for you which you can easily plug and play 
while doing your integrations.</p>
