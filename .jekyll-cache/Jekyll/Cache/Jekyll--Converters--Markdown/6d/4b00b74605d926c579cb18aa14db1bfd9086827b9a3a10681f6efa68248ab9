I"l<p>APPSeCONNECT processflows suite features an extensive interface that provide the ability to easily create digital maps 
to make out robust processflows. The drag-and-drop interface is easy to use by any citizen integrator. With the aid of 
processflow feature, users can now graphically organize, create and view the data flow of a process thereby enabling 
customers to design integration anytime and anywhere with the help of our cloud portal. Thus, processflow supports 
tailored business rules, email templates, automation flows and monitoring process. You can now build and deploy 
processflows, from simple to sophisticated, through a modern, native-cloud platform.</p>
