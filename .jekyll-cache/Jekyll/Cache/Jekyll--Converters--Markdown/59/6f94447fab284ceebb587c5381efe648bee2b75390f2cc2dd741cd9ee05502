I"<p>Partners &amp; Developers or any other user (except the client) can now, no longer be able to login into the client environment, 
due to APPSeCONNECT License Management.</p>

<p>As each OP Agent, for each organisation in APPSeCONNECT, are now registered using a License key which is generated 
using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Organisation ID</code> &amp; the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MAC ID</code> of the system thereby preventing other systems &amp; users from logging in.</p>

<p>Partners/Developers requires to login to the client OP Agent for the purpose of implementing or debugging 
client issues and features. Therefore, APPSeCONNECT provides the temporary license key generation feature for the Partners
and the Developers, such that they can login in the client environment for work purpose.</p>

<h3 id="working-principle-for-generating-temporary-license">Working principle for Generating Temporary License</h3>

<p>Super Admins of APPSeCONNECT will be able to generate a temporary License key from the portal, for any organisation, 
which is needed to be accessed. The key will be valid for a limited time as selected from the portal. Using the generated key, 
partners/developers can log in to client environment using their (partners/developers) own agent credentials.</p>

<p><strong>Note: Only an APPSeCONNECT user with Super-Admin access, will be able to generate the temporary License Key for 
Organizations.</strong></p>

<h2 id="scenario-of-license-key-validation-failure-while-generating-license-key">Scenario of License Key Validation Failure while generating License Key</h2>

<p>Four different scenarios are mentioned within:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If you are using your existing licence key for the same MAC ID whereas you MAC Name has been renamed.
In this scenario the user will face license key validation failure because in order to 
generate License key, we use both Computer name + Machine ID and unique id generated 
for the organization. Each license uniquely identifies a particular machine. You cannot 
license a machine with a license generated from another machine. In this case, your 
license will say invalid.</li>
  <li>You have copied the installed folder and files from C: ProgramData folder to another machine.</li>
  <li>You have installed new network adapters which changes MAC ID of network interface.</li>
  <li>You have changed the Computer name of the machine.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="workaround-for-license-key-validation-failure">Workaround for License Key Validation Failure</h2>
