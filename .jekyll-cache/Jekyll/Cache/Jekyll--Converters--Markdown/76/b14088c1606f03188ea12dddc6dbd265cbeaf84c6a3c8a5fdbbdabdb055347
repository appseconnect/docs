I"4<p>Data dependency is a concept which requires the data which are mutually dependent on one another to be kept in sync. 
As dependent data is always required to be transferred during the primary data synchronization, these data is somewhat
 inseparable to make any meaningful data on the business application. For instance, let us suppose, a reference of one
 particular data is present inside another process, such that you need the data to be available in first place to complete
 this operation, in such case, we manage the data synchronization so that the dependent data is synched before doing
 the dependent data sync. While defining business process integration, you need to identify dependencies between APIs
 and processes correctly to create workflow such that the data between application can feely flow.</p>
