I"Ò<p>This is a very common scenario where syncing records incrementally in one direction between two applications, occurs. 
An incremental (or ‚Äúdelta‚Äù ) sync is a process where the data records that have changed (created or modified) after the last time the integration ran as opposed to processing the entire data set every time. 
It is the favoured approach for most point-to-point integration scenarios since by restricting the number of 
records being processed to only what has changed, it permits the integration to run more rapidly 
and proficiently which in chance allows it to run more frequently to keep systems up to date.
Designing and executing an incremental sync does require more effort than simply syncing all records every time.</p>
