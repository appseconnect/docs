<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>ISSUE 1:
Some of the basic troubleshooting issue happens due to improper validations or even if it is accurately validated and if touchpoints do not sync, this basic issue resolves after removing the Temp and Cache files 
from the portal and from your system. Therefore, after clearing all this publish the touchpoints again along with Update Configuration on the agent.</p>

<p>For E.g. If the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Source Application Not Found</code> in the log file appears, the probable cause is due to the presence of the Temp and Cache Files.</p>

<h2 id="attributes-and-actions">Attributes and Actions</h2>

<p>While defining a connect to a particular API endpoint in Uniconta, you require clear understanding about the data requirements 
and endpoint configurations. You can refer to this document to find all the endpoint details of your Uniconta installation. 
To define the endpoint in APPSeCONNECT, you need Actions and Entities. Actions are specifically targeted for a particular 
endpoint while schema is the data needed to execute the API. Here, is the list of some of the pre-packaged API actions defined 
for you which you can easily plug and play while doing your integrations.</p>

<p>Uniconta has a generic API Document. <a href="https://www.uniconta.com/developers-unipedia-global/uniconta-api/">Click here</a> to know about the API Code structure. 
For viewing the related APIs, Navigate through the Provided pathway:
