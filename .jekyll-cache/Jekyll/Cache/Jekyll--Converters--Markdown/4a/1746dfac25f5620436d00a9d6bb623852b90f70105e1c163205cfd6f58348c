<p>In Business, you may not have time for redundant data or data which is of no use to the business. Your Business can be Country specific or certain sets of customer specific and therefore you may not require data which are not oriented to you business. Therefore, in such case you may need to deal with data that are redundant.</p>

<p>APPSeCONNECT Process Flow is enabled with a decision node that will not execute the data that does not fulfills your decision criteria. The below image will help you design a process flow with the Decision Node.</p>

<p><img src="\staticfiles\processflow\media\pfdecision1.PNG" alt="PFdecision1" /></p>

<h3 id="understanding-conditions">Understanding conditions:</h3>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">For Ex:</code> A Decision condition is implemented where the operation evaluates and extracts the errored data and routes to a flow where the data are process for correction.</p>

<p>The set of data that fulfils this condition, are marked as passed and is posted to the respective application. These Routing conditions can be applied in other scenarios as well where the decision condition filters data related to other specific mapping scenarios or data with different response code from its source API. These condition checks can alter as per your business requirement.</p>

<p>The following are the fields that you will get on dragging the Decision Node in the Process Flow Designer Panel.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Node Description:</strong> Here, you can provide a short description for the Decision Node.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Decision Name:</strong> Here, you can provide a short name that will help identify the purpose of the Decision Node when working later.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Decision Key:</strong> This is the actual field which decides the execution process of the decision node. Your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Decision Key</code> can be applied in these following areas:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Decision on <strong>Attribute</strong>:</p>

        <p>Applying Decision on <strong>attribute</strong> allows the node to decide the condition over the value passed through the attribute.</p>

        <p>As all data for an Entity (For Ex: Order, Business Partner etc ) are transfered through packets which are further made up of attributes, you can implement your business flow by applying condition on required attribute. If decision node meets up the condition expression provided, the data will be passed.</p>

        <p>_ <strong>Note: On applying decision on attribute using Xpath, the condition will be traversed only for the first data in the whole packet. You can implement splitter node  after GET such that every packet are splitted into single packet, for implementing decision on each data after transformation.</strong>_</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Decision on <strong>Static Values:</strong></p>

        <p>Static Values are any random values that can be provided in the Decision key for allowing condition check in the Process Flow. Any value that is provided in Decision Key with or without conjunction can be a Static Value. Static Values can be provided to check and verify whether the node successfully execution the decision nodes.</p>

        <p>In Business Perspective, any decision key if provided be it the generic function or Attibute value extraction though XPATH or a cloud appresource function provided in Decision Key will be considered as a static Value.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> You can only provide those Appresource Functions (both Cloud &amp; Generic) as Decision Key which are defined either in Process Flow Level or Organisation level or APPSeCONNECT level.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Operator:</strong> You will be provided with a list of operators thats will enable the key to take the decision.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Value:</strong> Here, you need to provide the value for the KEY provided.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Add Criteria:</strong> You can also add multiple combined conditions &amp; conjunctions using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AND</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OR</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Toggle button:</strong> You will be able to activate multiple conditions by activating/deactivating the toggle button.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Preview URL:</strong> You can view the complete expression that will be generated as per the condition the Preview URL box below. In-Case, the final expression in the URL preview is too long, you need to hover, to view the complete expression.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>You need to have valid credentials of the portal.</li>
  <li>You need to <a href="/processflow/creating-processflow/">create a Process Flow</a> or need to have an existing Process Flow developed.</li>
  <li>When working with Cloud Appresource function in Decision Node, you need to define the function before implementing the decision criteria. <a href="/processflow/cloud-appresource-functions/">Click Here</a> to know more about Process Flow cloud appresource function.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="working-principle">Working Principle:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Drag the decision node in the designer panel from the Process Property menu. The Decision Node Configuration Window opens.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="\staticfiles\processflow\media\pfdecision2.PNG" alt="PFdecision2" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You can view the above mentioned fields. Enter the name &amp; node description.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click on the <strong>Add Criteria</strong> button. You can view the fields for providing the condition.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="\staticfiles\processflow\media\pfdecision3.PNG" alt="PFdecision3" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You need to provide the Decision KEY, for commanding the Decision Operation. Here you can view the decision key applied on the Decision Attribute.</p>

    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Implementing Decision as Static.</p>

    <p><strong>Description:</strong> In this case, the scenario is implemented with fact keeping in mind that only if the node is able to prove that both the static values provided in the fields <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Decision Key</code> &amp; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Value</code> is equal, the data will be passed as success.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Decision Key:</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">20</code></li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Operator:</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=</code></p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Value:</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">20</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>AND</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Decision Key:</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">40</code></li>
      <li><strong>Operator:</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=</code></li>
      <li><strong>Value:</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">40</code></li>
