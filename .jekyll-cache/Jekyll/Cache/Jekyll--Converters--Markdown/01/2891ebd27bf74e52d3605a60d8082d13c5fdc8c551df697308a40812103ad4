I"<p>Policies are hooks to an API which you can punch at differnt levels of execution. They are powerful capabilities to an API publisher
that can impose some change in behavior of an API. Policies are collection of statements which are execued sequentially
on the request or response of an API. They are applied either before execution of actual action (stated as InBound policies) or 
after the actual action has been executed (termed as Outbound Policies). Some policies can change the Http Pipeline of an API execution 
altogether.</p>
