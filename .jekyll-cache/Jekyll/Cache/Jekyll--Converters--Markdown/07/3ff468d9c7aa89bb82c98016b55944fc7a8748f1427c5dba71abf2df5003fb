I"ÿ<p><a href="http://isdn.appseconnect.com/html/9B9A41E5.htm">Plugins</a> are a piece of software which lets to tightly couple with the platform to enhance the platform
and / or improve performance of the integration. As you know the default integration platform is sufficient
to build any integration out of the box, but still we thought for advanced need, there should be separate hooks which an enterprise developer or team of 
developers might need to build plugins on top of our components. The plugin is built using the SDK to enhance or change functionality of how the platform 
behaves. For instance, you can build a plugin which will allow you to move our data storage to a separate database rather than the inbuilt databases 
which we provide by default.</p>
