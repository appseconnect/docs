<p>In APPSeCONNECT Workflow using a Self-loop, we can repeatedly execute an individual node without affecting the other nodes that are linked with it. If we draw a self-loop in GET element in Workflow it will ask for the no of times it will be executed. Letâ€™s take a scenario where touchpoint associated with the GET node can fetch 10 records at a time but I want to fetch a minimum of 50 unsynced data at a time if it is available. Here I can implement a self-loop with 5 occurrences.If I want to fetch all unsynced data then we can choose the until data available option.</p>

<h2 id="self-loop-scenarios">Self Loop Scenarios:</h2>

<p><strong>Case 1: When Self loop applied in GET Node</strong></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> You may have a scenario to fetch data for a specific input, which signifies if your input value is 5, the self-loop on get would be executed 5 times. 
If your input value is 2, the self-loop would be executed twice.</p>

<p><strong>Case 2: When Self loop applied in POST Node</strong></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> You may have a business scenario where you are splitting the transformed data as 1 single packets, and then posting it to destination application. Therefore, if Self Loop on POST node is not applied, only a single data after a splitter would be posted. 
Applying self-loop will fetch data until available after splitting.</p>

<p>For Example: you may have Splitted a transform packet in a batch of 1, which contains 10 data. Therefore, after splitting, it will generate 10 packets for 10 different data. 
If self-loop on POST node is configured as Until Available, self-loop on post will execute until all the data are fetched after split.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note: Adding self-loop is not mandatory after splitter or merger node, however it is self-loop is recommended seriously to minimize the loss of data by a great margin in such cases.</em></strong></p>
