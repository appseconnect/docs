    <p>While defining a connection to an API endpoint in Lightspeed, you require clear understanding about the data requirements and endpoint configurations. You can refer to this document to find all the endpoint details of your Lightspeed Application.
To define the endpoint in APPSeCONNECT, you need Actions and Entities. Actions are specifically targeted for an endpoint while schema is the data needed to execute the API. Here, is the list of some of the pre-packaged API actions defined for you which you can easily plug and play while doing your integrations.</p>
