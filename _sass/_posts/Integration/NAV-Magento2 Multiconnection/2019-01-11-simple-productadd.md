## Brief Description

![wrkflw_simpleprdct_navmagemulti](/staticfiles/integration/media/wrkflw_simpleprdct_navmagemulti.png)  
In this integration scenario, multiple connections have been made for transformation of Simple Products from  Ms Dynamics NAV to Magento2 (along with multiple Magento websites from a single Magento admin). 
* Login to the Ms Dynamics NAV Client and create a new item from the Items Page. 
* Provide the details of the item and also enter the web data related details like WebProductDetails, website, attributes, category.
* Click the WebItemFlag checkbox and also choose the application ID (application ID should be defined in the AEC application table while syncing setup). 
![simpleprdct_navmagemulti1](/staticfiles/integration/media/simpleprdct_navmagemulti1.png)
* Input the details for multiple connections that can be selected from the drop downs of the 
* Web Product Details CP Page - Select the `ConnectionName`, `ApplicationName`, `WebAttributeSetId` and enable the checkbox for `WebItemFlag`.

**NOTE: The same product can be added to multiple connection by creating a new line in Web Product Details CP Page and choosing the desired connection name. Further repeat the same steps as discussed above for the newly chosen connection.**

* Web Product Websites Page - The `ConnectionName` & the `WebsiteID` needs to be selected from the Drop-down.

* Web ProductAttribute Page - Select the `ConnectionName`, `AttributeID` and the `AttributeOptionId` from the drop-down for the product that needs to be synced to Magento.  
**Note:** The `AttributeId`can be opted from the drop-down only when the `WebAttributeSetId` is selected from the `Web Product Details CP page`. The `AttributeOptionId` can be opted when the `AttributeId` is selected.

Click OK button on creating the Item.

**NOTE: There is no need to create duplicate products in NAV to be synced in Multiple Magento.**

## Lookup Mapping

The Lookup mapping for currency shall be required in case the business logic deals with multiple currencies.

## Attribute Mapping/Transformation

Following the Provided Mapping, the user can sync the Simple Product Add from Ms Dynamics NAV to Magento2. 
To know more, see [Mapping & Transformation Techniques](/transformation/steps-to-cutomize-prebuilt-mapping/).
