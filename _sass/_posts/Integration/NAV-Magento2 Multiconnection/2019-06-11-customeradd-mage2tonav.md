**(1) For Integrating B2B customer to MS Dynamics NAV**

the user needs to go through the following steps & mapping process.

* The user needs to create an attribute named `B2B` with the datatype `String`.  
![addcustomer-mage2tonav3](/staticfiles/integration/media/addcustomer-mage2tonav3.png)  

* The user needs to apply an `IF condition` on B2B. The steps to create condition in attribute level are [given here](/transformation/define-logic-over-destination-mapping/#mapping-at-attribute-level).
* The clauses for the IF condition should be provided as given below:
