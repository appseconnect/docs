APPSeCONNECT is provider of both hybrid and cloud hosted applications which can connect two or more applications irrespective of ERP, Ecommerce or Marketplaces. 
It is called a hybrid solution because the platform gives a readymade end-to-end service which can be re-configured and downloaded from the `APPSeCONNECT Cloud` while all the credentials remain intact in the systems own premise. 

APPSeCONNECT is a platform that support any third party independent software vendor to work and develop connectors. 
APPSeCONNECT installs an Agent on the system's own premises, which downloads all the configurations from cloud to use them for synchronization operations done on-premise. 

The goal of the User Manual is to give a detailed overview of all the features of the product `APPSeCONNECT` along with a proper description of the components.

# Introduction to iPaaS

Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) is a group of cloud services which enables to execute and control the integration flow via on premises and cloud-based processes, applications and data within individual or across multiple organizations.
In iPaaS the third-party provider, gives infrastructure and middleware to manage the data integration on premises and cloud-based processes.

Generally Data integration happens between:

* Cloud to Cloud Applications: For e.g `Salesforce and Shopify`
* Cloud to On-Premise / On-Premise to On-Premise Applications (Hybrid): For e.g `Salesforce and SAP Business One`

# Hybrid Integration Model

Hybrid integration permits on-premises applications to flawlessly integrate with cloud-based applications. Most businesses presently prefer connecting their existing custom and packaged solutions and create a single platform for new services. 
APPSeCONNECT helps enterprises seamlessly connect applications both on-premises and in the cloud, allowing the development of hybrid architecture in which you have control over the data passed between specific applications.  

# Why is Cloud Integration necessary?

* Easily Accessible solution = Access business data real time from any device and in any location 
* Totally Flexible Platform = Simple browser-based management that requires no additional on premise infrastructure
* Scale up or down more Easily = Easy Scaling in terms of app count, user count or both

# APPSeCONNECT Architecture & Usability

Hybrid integration permits on-premises applications to flawlessly integrate with On-Premises Applications and as well cloud-based applications.
The Hybrid Integration Model also lets the Cloud Based Application to Integrate with similar Cloud Based Applications as well.  

APPSeCONNECT is a generic platform which enables users to deploy, run, and succeed in their integration projects. Using APPSeCONNECT, the users can run their integration processes completely in the cloud without the need to procure any software or the set-up required to operate it.  

![APPSeCONNECT-Architecture](/staticfiles/root/media/APPSeCONNECT-Architecture.png)   

Those who wish to deploy APPSeCONNECT platform, on-premise mode has the elasticity to run their integration processes by deploying the agent(s) behind the firewall, thereby obtaining greater control on where their data resides.
APPSeCONNECT recognizes that many users need their integration processes to communicate with applications that operate behind corporate firewalls for various security and regulatory compliance reasons.
APPSeCONNECT system architecture accommodates to both scenarios: `On cloud integration processes or On Premise behind corporate firewalls` to safeguard that corporate data does not get visible to the cloud.

APPSeCONNECT comprises of mainly two components.
**Cloud/Web**
**Agent***

It is a hybrid solution which can centralize your application(s) communication logic, business logic, and your custom data into configurable endpoints (also called as Touchpoints), which will eventually be downloaded to the APPSeCONNECT thin clients installed on your local server to transform your business data between applications

The server is configured with pre-defined templates which can provide you with a ready-made one-click solution to map basic business requirements with all functional endpoints between apps, while APPSeCONNECT also gives you an option to customize both the pre-defined touchpoints and/or new touchpoints to map your own business processes.

APPSeCONNECT Implementation is also categoreized into two types.
* **Cloud Implementation**
* **Hybrid Implementation**

## APPSeCONNECT License Management

License key-based authentication approach is security enhancement for your on-premise and cloud integrations. 
This mechanism authenticates users who tries to login to the integration client of APPSeCONNECT agent using 
a revocable, secure and unique license or a security token that is provided by the server.

### Working Principle for License Management

* When registered users log in for the first time, the server verifies the authentication, and generates a licence key based on machine credentials. 
* APPSeCONNECT tags each local system with the licence key such that the same licence key cannot be used from different system. 
* License key will be revocable and traceable, i.e. it can be removed or revoked when the subscription gets expired and renewed further.
* Each License key is generated considering the `Organization ID` and `MacID` which enhances the security of your application preventing 
  unauthorized access.

### Usability Aspect of License Management

* If the user who had access to the license key, leaves the organization. 
  Each connected organisation will have a separate key and it is simpler to track unauthorized connections. 

* License key implementation feature prohibits access to different organization from same environment 
  and this restriction is presently available from Agent 4.4 onwards.

**Scenario: If user 1 from organization 1 have already logged in to an Agent environment, user 2 of organization 2 will not be able to 
log in to the same Agent environment.** 

* Whenever a different organization user tries to login to same machine, they will get the following message:

![user-licensekey-failure](/staticfiles/root/media/user-licensekey-failure.png) 

* On-behalf login for client by the superuser will be stopped in OP Agent.
 
**NOTE:No implementer/partner/developer will be able to login separately for an organization which was available 
  for all earlier Agent versions of 4.3 and lower.**


## APPSeCONNECT Platform - Functional Menus

The APPSeCONNECT portal is the web-based interface where you can access APPSeCONNECT applications for integration, with the set of Functional menus. The [APPSeCONNECT portal page](https://portal.appseconnect.com/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2f#!) is easily accessible.

To know more about API Management, [Click here](/api-management/overview/).

# F. Workflows

`Workflow management` is group of instructions to the integration service in APPSeCONNECT.
APPSeCONNECT workflow application can be considered as a strong feature that uses the software to either partially or entirely automate a complex business process. Workflow is a concept that describes how process in business divides work activities into distinct roles, task, procedures and rules.

To know more about Workflow Management, [Click here](/workflow/overview/).

# G. Rules

## Rule Listing

APPSeCONNECT Rule listing enables you to perform ACTIONS like (raising a support ticket or sending an email) based on the type of events encountered during agent execution such as - `Execution Failure, Execution Start, Execution End`, via Rule Engine. 

During Agent execution, if some events are encountered such as *Application Crash*, automatically the Rule which you have defined on Application Crash will be triggered and it will perform the associated Action with that Rule.
You can also define additional criteria for triggering the Rule and performing the actions. 

In that case whenever the event will occur it will also check if the additional criteria are matched or not. If the additional criteria are matched then only the Rule will be triggered.

# H. Environment

This page lists the devices that have access to the project that the customer is working on. For environment details, [Click here](/getting-started/)


# I. Tickets

APPSeCONNECT support tickets are meant of clients who can place a ticket and set priority level while facing any problem while working on APPSeCONNECT.and you need to resolve it as early as possible. 

The implementers and the partners would be able to see the tickets and resolve them.

# J. Users

 Users is one of the main feature of APPSeCONNECT portal as this control over the access that a user has. Depending on the role of the user, the menu panel of the portal is customized such that the user can use the functionalities depending on the role allotted to him.
