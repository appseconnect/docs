AEC Connectors acts like a bridge to create connection between applications that connects different data sources both on-premise 
or in cloud (exposed to WWW) using standard protocol for communication. APPSeCONNECT comes with a number of 
connectors types which can connect any data source having standard protocol based communication channel 
established. The connectors are plug and play oriented and hence within APPSeCONNECT one can
