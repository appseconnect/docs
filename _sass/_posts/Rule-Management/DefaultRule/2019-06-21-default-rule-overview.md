Default rules are the rules that are predefined on APPSeCONNECT. User/Implementers cannot choose these rules and 
will not get any view of these rules as they are implemented in backend of APPSeCONNECT. As and when required, these 
rules would be deployed automatically. 

These are the default rules that are defined in APPSeCONNECT backend.
