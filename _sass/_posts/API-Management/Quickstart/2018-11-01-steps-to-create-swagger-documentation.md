prerequisites which is given in  [Create a Proxy API](/api-management/steps-to-create-proxy-endpoint/)

The Proxy API section will guide the user to create a new API, Provide Basic Information of API, Versioning of API, Apply Policy, Specify the 
backend services (The backend needs to be configured correctly by specifying the Application, Schema, and Action), The outboud policies,
and Response setup of the API.  

## Steps to Create Swagger Documentation

  shown and you can see all your connections listed here. Click on **Proxy**. Here you can view the list of Proxy API created or you if you are a 
  first time user, you can create a New Proxy API. `Add New` button enables to create a new Proxy API. Refer [Create a Proxy API](/api-management/steps-to-create-proxy-endpoint/)

Here you will view the `Organization Information, Base URL, Proxy API URL, Schema selection option, and the Proxy API Created`.

5. Select the Schema as HTTP from the drop down list and now you have to activate the `Authorize` button.

**Note: 1) Every-time, you open the SWAGGER window, you need to re-generate the username and password.    
        2) Every-time, you execute the Proxy API in Swagger endpoint you can view both success and failure messages.   
           e.g: The HTTP Response code for success/failure will come like 200 OK, 202 Accepted, 
           302 Moved Temporarily, 204 No Content, 206 Partial Content etc.**
